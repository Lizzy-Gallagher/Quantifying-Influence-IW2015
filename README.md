# Independent Work (Fall 2015)
A working repository for my data mining / machine learning independent project at Princeton University.

**Update:**
As of January 7th 2016, the project is complete! Many thanks go out to my advisor Professor Thomas Funkhouser. The link to the final paper is [here](Report/written_final_report.pdf).

**Abstract:**
*In this paper, we attempt to isolate quantifiable features of a Wikipedia editorâ€™s user history that contributes to their success or failure in the sitewide Request for Adminship (RfA) elections. Unsurprisingly, we find that the most influential features are those most central to the Wikipedian mission: sustained and voluminous collaboration and individual contribution. As an additional conclusion, we find that decision tree class of classifiers is particularly effective at representing the thought process of voters in the RfA elections as they parse through leveled priorities and self-imposed quotas.*
