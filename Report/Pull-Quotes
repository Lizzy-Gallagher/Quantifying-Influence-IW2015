TXT:Impressed with wisdom and overall high clue quotient shown in frequent comments and actions at [[WP:AN]]/[[WP:ANI]].  Thoughtful, helpful, cool, and (based on the fact that I agree about 75% of the time) smart. <small>("Very smart" would have required agreeing with me over 90% of the time...)</small> Significant mainspace contributions help make up for all the useless admins like me who don't write. --

TXT:'''Oppose''' - Excellent editor, unfortunately I see virtually no activity in admin-related areas, and while some (including myself) might consider it refreshing to find a candidate that doesn't immerse themselves in the standard or become embroiled in ANI drama, I can't ignore this fact.

TXT:'''S'''upport. Graham is a content beast. I think all content beasts, especially in the field of GA/FA content, should have the option of admin tools provided they are unlikely to abuse them. This content beast can be trusted.

TXT:Oh, boy... '''Weak oppose''' on account of recently heavy activity and relatively low count. Ditto with [[WP:Requests for adminship/Foxy Loxy 2|another ongoing candidate]], {{user2|Foxy Loxy}}. --

TXT:'''Weak oppose''' Too inexperienced for me to trust. Lack of both admin-related and article-writing experience, as shown by Q7.
