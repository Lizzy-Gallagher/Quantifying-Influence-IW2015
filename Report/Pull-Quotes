TXT:Impressed with wisdom and overall high clue quotient shown in frequent comments and actions at [[WP:AN]]/[[WP:ANI]].  Thoughtful, helpful, cool, and (based on the fact that I agree about 75% of the time) smart. <small>("Very smart" would have required agreeing with me over 90% of the time...)</small> Significant mainspace contributions help make up for all the useless admins like me who don't write. --

TXT:'''Oppose''' - Excellent editor, unfortunately I see virtually no activity in admin-related areas, and while some (including myself) might consider it refreshing to find a candidate that doesn't immerse themselves in the standard or become embroiled in ANI drama, I can't ignore this fact.

TXT:'''S'''upport. Graham is a content beast. I think all content beasts, especially in the field of GA/FA content, should have the option of admin tools provided they are unlikely to abuse them. This content beast can be trusted.

TXT:'''Support'''. Looking over your last RFA, I'd have to agree that you weren't yet ready. However, now is definitely the time to promote. I'm not taking WerdnaBot into consideration, as I don't consider bot work in an RFA (see my [[User:Useight/RFA Standards|admin criteria page]]), just your own work, and I think your work is good. I don't really like that you have more Wikipedia namespace edits than mainspace, but since you do have over 1000 mainspace, that's not really a big deal.

TXT:'''Support.''' An experienced and level-headed editor with a solid mainspace and projectspace contribution record, including substantial AfD participation. I looked at quite a few of his AfD !votes, and while I do not necessarily agree with all of them, WilliamH gives civil, reasoned and substantive arguments. I trust that he will interpret consensus and enforce the policies correctly.

TXT:'''Weak Support'''. An excellent mainspace contributor and great vandal fighter. Nearly 6000 edits. Good enough for me. The lack of Wikipedia Talk edits is disappointing.
