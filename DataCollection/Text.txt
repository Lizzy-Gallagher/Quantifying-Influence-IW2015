Like them, I like to see well-rounded administrator candidates who have a sound appreciation for editors who create content and have shown some talent for doing so themselves.  Wikipedia is, after all, an encyclopedia, and our principal purpose is to create good content; that purpose includes all users, including admins.  That having been said, I think BDD has demonstrated he knows how to write well enough in the English vernacular, and how to create an encyclopedia article based on a dozen or more among the 38 articles he has created.  Sure, I would love to see several Good Articles among his accomplishments, but he's also shown that he has a strong command of policy and a head full of good sense.

This editor seems deserving of the trust needed for the admin tools. - <b>'''Oppose''' Bilby seems to be a very fine candidate in most respects. But Warden has highlighted a problem. On the [[Ugg boots trademark disputes]] article, there has been a series of Requests For Comment. The first one was closed improperly by an Australian problem editor who has been involved in repeated misconduct. The second one has an obvious meatpuppet case by another Australian editor described [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADpmuk&diff=555224192&oldid=555093685 here], and another possible case that is more subtle and much more damaging to Wikipedia described [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUgg_boots_trademark_disputes&diff=553967503&oldid=553963004 here], also possibly involving several Australian editors. As I have said on the Talk page, it looks good but it smells bad. I think Bilby is a fine editor. He is the best Australian editor involved in that series of articles. But when the trouble started, he disappeared. Bilby has done nothing to counsel the problem editors from Australia and improve their behavior. Instead he has become their ally whenever they needed one. Therefore I am concerned that we are giving administrative powers to one side in a content dispute. I am also concerned that the first RFC was closed improperly, and the second may be closed improperly in a very similar way. Consensus should be determined by [[WP:CONSENSUS#Determining_consensus]]: "Consensus is determined by the quality of the arguments given on the various sides of an issue, as viewed through the lens of Wikipedia policy." The number of votes is not mentioned and should not matter. Also, in [[Wikipedia:Closing_discussions]]: "Consensus is not determined by counting heads." But the first RFC was closed by the Australian problem editor, by counting votes and ignoring policy arguments. The second time it was closed, the administrator admitted that one side had stronger policy arguments, but he allowed the larger number of votes on the other side to balance it, producing a "no consensus" result. This RFC needs greater participation by experienced editors who will rely on policy, not the number of votes. Bilby has voted on the side that has more votes and no policy arguments. Then he disappeared. This raises doubts about how he would use administrative tools if they are given to him. I regret I must oppose this nomination.'''Support''' - He may not be a constant work-horse, but we need all the help we can get. He seems to be a competent, levelheaded editor and familiar with the various administrator forums and procedures. I don't see any problems, personally.'''Support''' It takes all kinds.  Gnomes are important too.'''Oppose''' with some regret.  I would need to see some significant, recent interaction with other users (including collaboration on article creation and improvement).  And although I don't believe an admin needs to be a premier prolific content creator, I do believe that admins need to have at least '''''some''''' nontrivial content experience (more than just gnoming).  I would be much more attracted to your candidacy if you were to get at least one or two Good Articles under your belt.  Also, please take to heart the various concerns that have been raised about the civility issue (including disruptive superficial civility or "civil POV pushing" as described in [[WP:PUSH]]) — this has become a very serious issue, and we need to become more conscious of it.  —'''Support''' - Great candidate for admin. He has his admin experience from commons and have also been doing great work in english wikipedia.

We need a lot more people like INeverCry. --Calm and clueful, particularly in the area that he's planning on working in: that handily counters the relatively low participation in FFD here on en-WP.

I'd like to have seen more participation at AfD etc, but on the whole I think this candidate is a net positive to the project and can be trusted with the admin toolset.'''Support''' It appears they have plenty of relevant experience. <span style="font-family:times; text-shadow: 0 0 .2em #7af">~'''Support''' Long term editor with obvious commitment to the project so I don't see why not. I don't really understand the opposes citing his response to question 1. On the one hand, we don't seem to like editors who work solely toward adminship and on the other hand we lambast editors who are willing to become admins without any specific agenda in mind. I, for one, will always prefer an editor who hasn't really thought about being an admin before but has demonstrated a strong commitment to the project. Being an admin should be a sideshow to editing on Wikipedia, not the main event. --'''Support''' per Newyorkbrad. He genuinely wants to help by working on something that unfortunately needs edit full protected permissions that would help the community. He may have been a little too candid with answer one and maybe could have written it a little differently while conveying the same intent, but I can't see holding the request for not wanting to be among the most active of admins. Also, this wouldn't be the first time we gave the sysops for performing technical changes to protected pages or templates.'''Support''' because like others have said, there is no reason to believe that the tools will be misused. I think Pichpich responds to the oppositions over "boredom" very well and hope that the closing bureaucrat will not weigh these oppositions too much. I do think that Mephistophelian brings up a good case about the quality of Jason Quinn's contributions and hope that Jason will review the points made if he is to deal with sourcing issues on an admin level. Otherwise, the mop should be No Big Deal.'''Support'''.  What does Jimbo have to say on the issue?  He [[WP:DEAL|decided]] to "make a bunch of people who have been around for awhile sysops".  Anyone who's been active here for '''nine years''' with no problems can be trusted, and everyone who can be trusted should be an admin unless they don't want to.  In particular, I don't understand why people simultaneously oppose for "bored" and for "I'm just going to edit protected pages" — if you're bored, you'll probably find yourself fulfilling lots of other admin tasks as well.  Since it's just a technical matter that sysop powers aren't given to everyone, you should have them if you qualify.  Finally, it's not as if we have a limited number of admins, so there's nothing wrong with giving tools to a trustworthy person who will use them only rarely, and every protected page that Jason edits is one less task for the rest of the admins to worry about.'''Support.''' I have never actually had any interaction with Jason but after looking at his contributions, intentions and answers to questions I feel that having the admin flag would benefit the project. He is honest, as shown in question 1, has far more content writing under his belt than I did when I flaged and nothing shows that he would missuse the tools. His intentions are all good and nodoubt he would help out with current admin team. I hope the closing crat reads all of the supports and opposes carfully as there are some really 'special' ones out there which seem to have very little, if any reasoning behind them. As Filelakeshoe said in a comment "adminship wasn't a big deal" and in years past anyone would be handed the flag as long as their intentions were good and they had a little evidence of that. Jason has both good intentions and a massive history to back it up. ''''''Support''' - I dithered a bit on this, but I decided that I'd like to support. I don't think you're a stellar candidate, but you do have quite a number of contributions to diverse areas and seem knowledgeable enough about policies and guidelines. I think that wanting to edit protected pages is a viable reason to be an admin, and at least you don't seem willing to jump into things you don't understand to screw them up. :) I see no red flags about your past either, so you have my support. -- ''''''Support''' I like Q1--honesty is a good quality for an admin to have. We have a number of admins who use the tools sparingly but uncontroversially, and I don't mind letting him join them.'''Support'''. A welcome addition to the admin corps. Not swayed by any of the opposes. Candidate has shown he is trustworthy and genuinely wants to improve Wikipedia, and if the admin toolset reinvigorates his desire to do that, all the better. Also per Ched above. --'''Support''' Even if JQ only uses the tools a few times for a purpose beneficial to the encyclopedia JQ should have the tools. I don't think JQ will use any of the extra buttons in a way that is detrimental to Wikipedia. <b><font color="teal">The opposes are deeply unconvincing, and pretty much a textbook example of the lazy stop energy ("oh look, the nom statement has something I disagree with in it, thank God I don't have to bother looking through their user's contributions before making up my mind") that forms a key part of modern RFA's problems. Plenty of clue demonstrated by the candidate, a solid contributions history weighted away from drama, and no red flags. This is not hat-collecting: it's a trustworthy editor asking for the community to help him out a bit in improving the project by granting him a few extra bits. If he reciprocates that trust by doing the odd bit of backlog reduction in addition to his significant content work, all the better.'''Support''' - Initially I was concerned about the boredom factor that some have opposed for but having thought about it more I decided that it's not really an issue. I trust this user with the tools, activity isn't really a reason for opposition.

The candidate is a dedicated, experienced editor who has made useful contributions in a wide variety of ways.

While I am sure Lord Roem will take the other concerns raised on the RfA into account going forward, on balance I find him to be an excellent candidate and am glad to be supporting him.'''Neutral''' I really like Lord Roem as an editor, but I am cautious to support as an administrator for the reasons Salvio and Tryptofish lay out.  I'm split between supporting because the user is a good user, and opposing because the candidate has focused on becoming an administrator.  As the candidate pointed out by quoting NW, intent is important.  In this case, I question whether the intent is to be an admin or to help Wikipedia.

For me, editor contributions at AFD are about consensus building, while admin closes at AFD are about consensus reading. I don't think one necessarily makes for good practice for the other. Take RFPP for example - how are you supposed to "learn RFPP" as a non-admin? By making lots of requests? [[User:Salvidrim|Salvidrim]] was recently granted the bit, jumped in at RFPP and made some cracking calls, including rejecting one of the half-arsed, half-asleep requests I made in frustration late one night.

An editor who doesn't even consider [WP:BLPPROD] when evaluating "a newly created BLP which has no sources" isn't showing enough understanding of the deletion process to be given the tools to manage that process.'''Weak oppose'''. Sigh. I don't want to be here when a candidate is clearly a good, likable, and conscientious editor. Edits and tenure are fine. My problem is when a candidate says they want to work in X, then I will judge with reference to X. ANI is about conflict, but Q3 doesn't describe experience with conflict. I'd expect an editor with 9K article/talk edits to have bumped into some difficult editors; the candidate has apparently avoided that learning experience. The desire to work in ANI is odd given edit stats imply < 63 edits to ANI; editors don't have to be admins to comment there. AfD is also mentioned, but the experience there is minimal and the main diagonal is poor. Q8 gives an explanation about using policy arguments in AfD comments, but Northamerica1000's question misleads with "congruent with other editor opinions". The AfD stats show congruence with the closing admin's determination of consensus and not whether one voted with or against the crowd. That's a subtle but important distinction; policy arguments should trump a majority w/o policy; a poor main diagonal indicates a problem with applying policy rather than failing to follow the crowd. Examining some AfDs leaves me more uncomfortable; the experience/judgment is not there. For a candidate who wants to work at ANI and AfD, I need to see better evidence of good judgment. I want to go the other way, but 68% is difficult to swallow. It looks like you'll get the bit; please be careful with it.'''Sweet kid, but light on the writing'''.

That was a no win scenario as Nthep gave a number of answers to cover what he thought was the question. I thought it was fine but the contributor that was asking flipped out and "nutted" up.

Some of the comments in  the oppose section  have their merits while some others are just  pile-ons, votes from raw newbs, or from  voters who  should find a new hobby. On  the face of it, Secret  has far more than enough experience and should not  be judged on events of the distant past. I  voted neutral on  the previous attempt and I am far happier supporting  this RfA than I  would, for example, for  some marginal, relatively new, hat-collecting teenager who  happens to  check  all  my  boxes. His work as an admin  would be very  much  under the loupe anyway, and as long  as any  advice he gets is given in  a collegial  manner, he will  be a net  positive to  the corps of sysops.'''Oppose''' -  While I am sympathetic to the editor's medical issues, I find that a cursory inspection of the past few years precludes my ability to support for adminship. Hoping your health improves and best wishes always.'''Oppose'''.  Happy to have him as a fellow editor, but am not comfortable trusting him with the mop given the history here.--'''Sorry, But No'''. This RfA reminds me of that famous quote about doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. And as the tenth RfA, the editor's obsession with obtaining administrator responsibilities is embarrassing.Can't decide. Secret seems to be a hard-working and all-round nice guy... until things happen that go against him, and he is prone to flip out. I'm just concerned that, if he were to crack while in possession of the mop, things might get messy. —Not often I end up in the neutral section. My impression of Secret is that they are a solid editor, with a good degree of experience. Overall, I have a good impression of his editing over the past 12 months; however, there is just too much history for me to feel comfortable that he will cope with the pressures of adminship again. Tricky one...'''Neutral''' - I say this as someone with a repeated acquaintance with Secret. I think he's generally a good person, I like him, and would like to support him because I like him. But I can't. I can sometimes be strict (as most people are) when evaluating someone for adminship, and someone with a track record like Secret I couldn't support. If this was someone else asking for adminship I'd probably flat-out oppose but I can't bring myself to do so here. -- ''''''Support''' as nominator. Shirt58 is an exceptionally good editor, who demonstrates all the abilities I'd want in an administrator. One of which has recently been demonstrated is caution, he wanted to make sure he had time to handle this RfA, and that he was ready for it, which is why it's been a little while coming. I'd much rather have an administrator who considers the options before diving in!'''Strong support''' Shirt58 has all the right qualities: calm, extremely clueful, lots of experience, independent minded, good common sense, balanced demeanor and he is focused on improving Wikipedia.  I prefer those that look before they leap and he has shown to do just that.  An excellent candidate that I'm happy to support.'''Support''' Seen around a lot - can't recall any problems. Plenty of clue, polite and cautious.'''Support''' - I do not have a history of interaction with the candidate, but I like what I see in the nomination, the candidate's answers to the standard questions, and my review of the contributions history. Furthermore, I am unimpressed by the reasons given by the opposers. One of the concerns expressed by opposers relates to insufficient content experience. Although the user is a self-identified wikignome, unlike many wikignomes, I see a solid record of contributing personal sweat and intelligent thought to content creation, both by creating new pages and by making substantive improvements to other pages. Another concern expressed by opposers is a record of sometimes !voting "delete" in AfDs that ended as "keep". That should not be a concern -- it's far better, IMHO, for a user to say what they think than to !vote for an expected outcome so as to improve their "AfD score". --'''Support''' looks fine, no red flags. I don't think high-quality contributions are needed for doing the vast majority of admin tasks, and in contrast to oppose 3 I would suggest that requiring all prospective administrators to do GAs would be harmful to the project. '''''<font color="#FF0000">'''Support''' Good (if tardy) answers to additional questions, which I use to gauge a candidate's grasp of policy.'''Support''' - You seem like a nice guy who'd get the job done. <font face="webdings"><font color="#007FFF">ö</font></font><font face="segoe script">'''Oppose''' - at 60% of the AfDs they've participated in where the result was keep, they've argued for deletion (including several nominations).

Tokyogirl79 has been on my list of potential admins since before ''I'' was an admin; her contributions to book-and-author-related pages are first-rate and her tremendously in-depth arguments at AFD have always impressed me. I see absolutely no reason not to trust her with the toolkit; she's an assest to Wikipedia now and will only be more valuable with a mop.'''Support'''. I spotted this nomination in the making over the weekend, and I was very pleased to see it. I've seen Tokyogirl79 around the place a lot, doing all sorts of great work.

And I'm not changing my mind. I understand how some people need to see deleted pages for some reason. However, the English Wikipedia does not currently have a way to do so without assigning Administrator rights. We assign Administrator rights for the maintenance of the project. We do '''not''' assign them because someone needs one right that they can't get elsewhere. Per WMF Legal, any review of deleted material should go through a process ''identical in rigour'' to RfA... Not RfA itself. Until the community comes up with a RfDeleteview type system, we should '''not''' be hacking around it by just making "temporary" or "single-purpose" administrators. If West.andrew.g needs to view deleted pages for some reason, they can contact WMF Legal and either have a special group made for them, or have the Legal department okay a temporary (i.e. ''set'' length of time) adminship for him for that sole purpose. If West.andrew.g rins another RfA, and expresses believable wish to maintain the project with the admin toolkit, then I may support.'''Oppose''' – I'm sorry but I can not support this RfA. I am concerned that deleted contributions, rev-deleted personal information and other non-public information might end up in a spreadsheet for shared analyses that was never intended; but rather guarded against.&mdash;'''''<sub><font size="1">'''Neutral'''. This is the most unusual RfA since I saw a bot account at RfA a few years ago. West.andrew.g has helped Wikipedia with Stiki. However he has contributed little by way of content creation. Together with the declared intent to actually not undertake administrative duties, there is no compelling reason to grant the tools. I assume good faith with regard to his declaration to avoid any further spam/misuse of Wikipedia.'''Support''' One of the most intelligent and valuable wikipedians I have ever had the pleasure of collaborating with.'''Support'''; happy with this candidate and confident he has the community's trust.'''Support''' - yeah, I'd probably like to see some more substantive commentary at AFD because it would help others to understand ''why'' Ymblanter holds the views he does (which helps to establish consensus).

Last block 16 months ago. Some people just don't understand that a block isn't the end of the word -- everyone makes mistakes. Albeit you repeatedly made the same mistake, but you have shown in the past year+ that you have learned. I feel that as an administrator you would be a [[WP:NETPOS|net positive]] to the project. As an admin I would think that you would be more careful not to violate 3RR and/or cause an civility concerns; and if you did you would face appropriate consequences anyway. You seem to be experienced, and if you can keep your combat-like attitude (which is okay to have!) in check while acting as an administrator I think you'll be fine.'''Support''' Willing to face those against the march of time, we should strive to have those on the right side of history!'''Support''' If you seek perfection, you're in the wrong place. If you weigh the positives against the negatives, this candidate's positives outweigh the negatives.'''Support'''. Binksternet is a great contributor and I have faith in their judgment, in part because they know content. I'm sure they'll keep their their nose clean. Also, cool name.'''Support'''. Despite the lengthy block log, sometimes a passionate, tempestuous admin is just what the project needs. --'''Support''' Having voted early and watched this play out, I've been swayed by the candidate's handling of Q&A, and some of the well-considered supports from editors whom I deeply respect.  I have also had time to look more thoroughly at the candidates contributions, and the balance of content-vs-drama.  As a meager contributor, I am humbled by the candidate's contributions, realize that high-volume editing in contentious areas has risks, and now believe that the candidate is maturing.  I also think that the candidate will benefit from this RFA, and hope that it will actually be successful - I think they'll use the tools to the project's benefit, and restrain the bit when they are in contention.  --'''Weak oppose''' - I was ready to oppose rather strongly until I read what Dennis said below. I then almost ended in the neutral column, but six blocks total one of which within the past two years and the concerns over temperament raised by TP are too much for me. Another year of block free, civil editing and I might be inclined to support, but for now, [[User:Go Phightins!/Admin criteria|my criteria]] are not met.'''Oppose''' Six blocks total one of which within the past two years with temperament issues concerns me here, although I am satisfied with your content work.'''Weak Oppose''', subjeft of the RfA has made valuable contributions to Wikipedia, and outside of the realm of politics is an outstanding editor. As someone whose hands aren't clean, even when my intentions were IMHO the highest (which I believe that many editors who end up in those situations are), I can understand how the subject of the RfA ended up with the blemishes on their block log. It takes good editors with those good intentions to work through politically controversial subjects in order to achieve neutrality (if it is ever possible, and depending on what one's view of neutrality is). Unfortunately, it are those times that bring out the best and the worst in the name of good intentions. This has lead me to weakly oppose this RfA. It's not that the subject of this RfA is a bad person, and I believe that he/she is a great contributor of content, however as an Administrator keeping yourself above the fray is sometimes the most important aspect of the position. The way I see it those who work hard and get dirty, it is difficult to keep clean under the microscope that one subjects themselves to when they seek public office. Keep up the good work, but the high offices are not ready for Binksternet yet. Take the remarks above, see them as constructive criticism, and if Binksternet wishes to seek public office again, take sometime, stay out of those difficult areas, build a reputation for being neutral, and some time later, try again.--'''Oppose''' - Too combative. POV-pushing and history of behavior that I would rather not see in an admin. I would like to see admins who are more prone to resolving conflicts than starting them.--'''Support''', with surprise that he isn't already an administrator; I always assumed he was. I often see him at AfD, he has plenty of clue and a good attitude. I would not generally support a one-use-and-out request like this, but I am supporting in the hope that he will decide to stay on as an administrator once his current issue is over.  --'''Support'''. Carrite is one of the best editors on Wikipedia, and he's honest and direct. He certainly can be trusted to use the tools in a NPOV and polite fashion, representing the consensus of the community. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">'''Support''' as I agree with the impressions in Dennis Brown's nomination; I also heartily agree with Joe Decker's comments immediately above. <font face="Comic sans MS">'''Support'''... this "temporary" stuff is silly, but he'd be a good addition to the meat grinder for as many days or moons as he is willing to offer.

WP needs 20 of him in the admin corps. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|<font color="green">'''SB_Johnny'''</font>]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;<sup>'''Support'''. I fully support Carrite's request: he is experienced and to be trusted. Also, per DGG, absolutely, and Dennis.'''Support'''. I see no likelihood that he will cause any damage with the tools, so he should have them. So what if he doesn't use them for other purposes? Neither do I, and probably many other admins.'''Oppose''' largely per Wizardman. I'm not concerned about the "temporary" nature of the request, rather the reasons behind it. I think Wizardman and Hut are persuasive on ''that'' point. --''''''Oppose:''' Per Wizardman, Coren and Fluffernut.  If the user wants admin tools, he should go through a full and rigorous RfA process. If the community supports the idea of unbundling certain admin tools for specific use, then a proposal should be made on the village pump for an alternative usergroup to be created that would allow such access on a temporary basis. Perhaps, the better privilege for this user to seek would be the one for scholars that allows the viewing of deleted contributions, conditional the submission of an academic paper on the topic. --'''Neutral''' Awaiting an answer to #9 for us not sure how the tools would advance the ArbCom case.'''Support without reservation''' Dirtlawyer and I have collaborated a great deal over the past three years within the realm of [[WikiProject College football]] and related projects.  He has been a great resource, sounding board, and partner in establishing and modifying a great number of standards for policy and formatting in the college sports world on Wikipedia.  I regard him as something of an adviser as his pragmatism and diplomacy have offered valuable counterpoints to my at times brash idealism.  His discussion comments are consistently well thought-out, well stated, and comprehensive yet succinct.  He will serve well as an administrator.'''Support''' on the basis of his excellent AfD contributions, and especially his Redirect that dealt with [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/University of Florida Career Resource Center]].

Frankly, what I see is someone in love with battle for battle's sake, who is willing to ride over consensus and who is arrogant in their beliefs and comments. I do thank the candidate for time spent here, and from what I am reading above, this is not someone I trust with a lifetime appointment to use the admin tools. ''I go so far as to ask those in support who are reading these words to reconsider their !vote.'''''Oppose''' I noticed this a couple of days ago and decided not to be negative because I thought the candidate's comments with the very unusual proposal about MOS were interesting and reasonable. However, the current commentary from the candidate regarding "canvassing" on the talk page of this RfA, and at [[WP:ANI#Procedural/canvassing issue in ongoing RfA]], show a strongly inappropriate style for an admin. The encyclopedia needs TLC, not the combative approach shown concerning the very minor issue of whether a particular notification violated [[WP:CANVASS]]. Also, there is perhaps a lack of understanding about what ANI can/will achieve: what if it were agreed that canvassing had occurred? How does the candidate think that would assist?You seem to have a tendency to panic and make hasty decisions at the very times when you need to be calm and think things through patiently.I have checked the candidate's deleted contributions, and I don't see anything out of place there. I have also looked through his comments at AfD, and I see impressively reasoned arguments and a good knowledge of our notability guidelines and precedents. However, I am worried that these two AfD comments[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_players_from_Quebec&diff=522634599&oldid=522552667][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/University_of_Florida_Career_Resource_Center&diff=534726226&oldid=534431477] may indicate a less-than-full understanding of the [[WP:RUD|guidelines on reusing deleted material]], and that this might lead the candidate to making bad calls on AfD discussions with comments that call for "[[WP:MAD|merge and delete]]". So I am reluctant to support at this time. — ''''''''Neutral''' - leaning towards oppose, but I don't very familiar with RfA's, so I'm not voting. I was made aware of this RfA as I'm one of those 122 watchers of [[User talk:GiantSnowman]], and I'm a little worried that those "thank you" messages can be a clever way of canvassing to make more people who support him aware of this RfA (especially [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Darkfrog24&curid=8196104&diff=537663206&oldid=521497119 this]).'''OPPOSE''', Jasper has been quite difficult and uncompromising in his interactions with myself. While conducting a GA review of one of his articles which contained plaigirism, he denied that it was present, thus delaying the review. If an editor cannot be bothered to check an article for plaigirism before nominating it for GA review, thus wasting the reviewers time, then I don't see how they can become an admin. Also, the concerns raised above are quite worrying. For those interested, [[Talk:Windows Server 2012/GA3]] and [[Talk:Windows Server 2012/GA2]] are the reviews in question.

Candidate's AIV reports are through the roof at 784 (I'd be satisfied with just 50). AfD is delete heavy, main diagonal is weak, but info is too sparse/stale for a current read. In a year-old RfA, a clueless candidate is going down in flames (5 support/29 oppose/3 neutral), and Jasper Deng adds a question with six subparts.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/GabeMc&diff=489572414&oldid=489569552] What was he thinking?

There ''are'' issues with a couple of admin/experienced editors (Who shall remain nameless) acting like they own the place.  While Kumioko's [[WP:Battleground]] mentality is concerning, I still feel that Kumioko would be a true [[WP:NETPOS|net positive]] for the encyclopedia with admin tools.  I would also urge the candidate to see reason, and realize that we are both going to wind up on the opposite side of consensus on this one, and withdraw the RfA.Candidate was blocked just 3 weeks ago for less-than-optimal behavior, which question 3 does not adequately address.--'''Oppose''' This user has become a complete negative for the project, with misguided rants on multiple pages—see [[WT:ACN]] for example.'''Oppose''' per Jasper Deng. A recent block is a major red flag for a admin candidate. ''''''Oppose''' - I supported in the first RFA, but have to oppose now. See also the immediate assuming bad faith regarding [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Aawerffa123]] in this RFA, there was no insinuation there. And per the waste of time in [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eduard_Frederich]]After fence-sitting and wavering in both directions, i have to come down here and say, '''Neutral'''.  I have no real issues with Kumioko's contributions, and i believe that he could contribute more if we could give him the tools he needs, which i would if i could; they are bundled, however, and we can't.  (And, unlike others, i don't see this as a reason to unbundle them ~ contradiction?  I am large, i contain multitudes ~ but as a reason to watch to whom we give them.)  In the end, i am worried by this quote from above '' I got frustrated at the system and some individuals'' and others like it, and the results that frustration leads to.  Honestly, i think Kumioko would be a great benefit to the project with the toolset...until something happened to frustrate him, and then we'd regret it.  I am sorry. Cheers, ''''''Support''' I tried to wade through the EEML stuff and make sense of it but have given up. So what I'm left with is this. A very useful content editor and former admin is asking for the bits back. The unintelligible mess was three years ago. Several of the stronger opposes below were on the opposite side of that case which is perhaps leading to battleground below. Ignoring the battleground below, this seems like a reasonable request for adminship. Blade and Salvio strongly support this editor. Good enough for me. --'''Support'''.  Brilliant user. The whole [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern European mailing list|EEML]] affair is ancient history. Can now be re-trusted with the tools. That said, It's obvious that this RfA will not pass. [[wikt:hadaway and shite|Hadaway and shite]], Giano.--'''Support''' people can definitely change. Piotrus looks like an amazing contributor who would not be a bad addition to the admin team. There can always be more eyes on the admin backlogs. Everybody deserbves a second chance.'''Support''' Piotrus is one of the pillars of this project, it's as simple as that. He has his views, he used to be a tad trigger-happy every now and then back in my wikiaddiction days, but still. I can't think of many people who would deserve the broom and bucket more than him. And yes, I know of EEML, his content-related disputes with plenty of people and so on. The bottom line is: every decent editor who specialises in anything but hard science, is going to make more enemies than friends. It's as simple as that, been there, done that. In history or social sciences (which seem to be the two main focuses of Piotrus' work here) there is no God-given truth. What one person writes about, say, WWII, another will question and yet another will call the original author names because of that. That's how things are, people are and will disagree about what this or that articles look like. But it doesn't mean they shouldn't be given access to useful tools. Those are two completely different things. ''<font color="#901">//</font>'''''Oppose'''. While three years may be enough to forgive the EEML incident, he has continued to show a temperament unsuitable for an admin. I am also not sufficiently convinced that he will not use admin tools while [[WP:INVOLVED|involved]]. -- [[User:King of Hearts|King of]]'''Weak oppose'''. (I should mention that Giano is an old friend of mine. We don't agree about everything, and he didn't canvas me about this RFA. I don't know any of the other opposers.) I started to type up a Neutral comment, because, while I thought there were some concerns about battleground with Piotrus, I wasn't opposed to adminship. We need more strong content contributors in the admin ranks. I also think he was mainly a good and useful admin in the past, and thought he would be useful now, and surely mindful of all the eyes that would be on his admin actions. I wish as many people watched ''all'' admin actions as would be watching Piotrus'! I still think this would be a protection against misuse, so this is not a strong oppose. But the way he threw himself gleefully into battling with the opposers on this page was too much for me. Piotrus, you're on display here, this is I presume your "best behaviour" that you're showing? Replying sarcastically to Giano isn't objectionable as such in my book—I'm not sensitive to that the way many people here are—but your tone and manner are. It's simply bad judgment to respond so aggressively (and at such ''length''!), no matter how he framed his oppose. As far as that goes, the oppose was strong but matter-of-fact and not rude. Anyway, Giano isn't requesting adminship here, you are. Your broad hint that ''he'' had something to do with a racist attack and call for assassination is just utterly unseemly: {{tq|"Btw, I wonder, is the attack page with my old address, calling me a Jew and asking for somebody to assassinate me still up at ED? Haven't checked it for years, but somehow I am reminded of it... can't think of the reason why."}} I couldn't believe it when I saw it. You could certainly help with many admin tasks, you're highly competent; but you've shot yourself in the foot with your demanour on this very page, as far as I'm concerned, sorry.'''Oppose''' - Piotrus is a great content contributor, but his attitude, level of civility, and previous issues truly worry me about giving him a new chance with the tools. That, combined with the compelling arguments presented above, makes me feel that I must oppose at this time.'''Oppose'''. Piotrus is an excellent editor. He made mistakes in 2009. However he has admitted his mistakes and learnt from the process. He edits Wikipedia in good faith and I believe that he is open about collaboration with other editors. Initially I was about to support. However his extended retort to Giano worries me, especially the sarcasm. The fact that Piotrus seems to have been riled so easily shows that he is unsuitable as an administrator, where discussions about admin actions can become heated.'''Oppose''' - per Dennis and Drmies; I respect the content creation, but the behavior in this RFA concerns me...a lot.'''Neutral''': Three years is a long time, more than a term in the United States House of Representatives. Content contribution is important, and not having any interaction (that I am aware of) with the subject of this RfA, I am unaware of any negative actions from the subject of this AfD since his/her return after the block. That being said I have to agree with some of what has been said above, due to the nature of some of the responses to the initial opposes I am now hesitant to support elevation of the former administrator back to administrator status. Perhaps this should be tried in another year, see if this improves.--'''Oppose'''. I am sorry, but I don't believe yo have enough experience in admin-related areas to be given the mop. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em;" class="texhtml">  '''I know the questions are optional, but such non-answers to Q1 and 2 disguised as answers don't sit well with me. Also, "not done" is not a decline rationale. -'''Oppose''' While the particular manner of Kiefer Wolfowitz's objection was less than civil, it did serve to shed interesting light on the temperament of this candidate. <strong>'''Oppose''', with advice for next time: RFA is when you are expected to demonstrate that you can handle the responsibilities of an administrator. If you can't even say what areas you ''might'' do admin work in, you are not going to pass. Period. You need to demonstrate that you are able to actually ''help'' with admin tasks, not just say "I've been here a while so I must be qualified, give me the tools and I'll figure out why later".  Work with [[WP:CSD]], clerking at [[WP:RFPP]], helping clear out bad bot reports at [[WP:UAA]], participation at [[WP:AFD]] that shows some understanding of consensus and deletion policy, these are the type of things non-admins can do to demonstrate they can handle the mop. If you don't want to do any of those things, you are not going to be good admin material. We don't just ride around on horses shooting bad guys, a lot of admin work is very routine and boring. If you don't want to help with that work there is no reason you should be an admin and you should just stick to content work, which is where your focus seems to be already anyway. So, you have a choice to make about where you want your wiki-career to go. Keep focusing on content and maybe one day you will be churning out featured articles, or focus on admin work and maybe you can pass RFA at a future date and become a member of the administrative corps. A few manage to do both at the same time, but they are the exception, not the rule.'''Oppose''', not now; should gain further experience as noted above.Contribs do show a dedicated vandal fighter; I'm a little concerned that this editor has only 281 edits to admin areas (AIV/RPP/AfD).

So, I went back and reviewed much of their January 2013 and December 2012 conribs.  Then looked through their Oct. and Nov. 2012 talk page archives.  While I get the impression of an editor who is quick to go about "fixing" things, I also see an editor that is (very) quick to revisit their own edits and admit to mistakes when called on.  The only real concern I noticed was a few discussions with Kudpung, and even there I perceived a "due respect" and willingness to listen.  While Theopolisme may not have the circumspection of a NYB (few do, myself included), they do remain calm and discuss things when asked.  In the end, while I may often want oppose due to "maturity" issues, I simply can't see this editor breaking anything that he wouldn't be immediately willing to fix if it was pointed out to him/her.  I see some good template work, consistent notification to other users when applying any editing that may concern them, and a lot of attention to minor fixes and improvements to references.   Mistakes and trouts perhaps - but I don't see any drama magnetism, egotism, or confrontational concerns. — <small><span style="border:1px solid #000000;padding:1px;"><b>'''Support''' Good candidate for admin and deserves to be one.'''Support''' Seems to be well suited to becoming an admin.'''Oppose''' You clearly have good intentions here, however your low edit count in the admin areas you expressed interest in is a little concerning.

I disagree with him on many things, in fact the main issue raised by the opposers is probably another area where we would disagree, but what I do know from interacting with Bbb23, is that when discussing disagreements, he keeps his cool and is open to discussion and to others' views, rather than jumping in with both feet. We need more administrators like that. --'''Strong oppose''' - I cannot support any nomination instigated by [[user:Drmies|Drmies]] because this editor has shown to lack civility and tact when it concerns issues relating to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Their [[Wikipedia:Systematic bias|systematic bias]] is especially when it relates to African issues, and their dismissiveness as if they are above every body else as you can see above is self evident.  I was going to ask Bbb23 some questions but there is not point wasting my time or his. In English Wiki, there also appears to be a lot of nominations by other administrators rather than by the old simple non-admin Wikipedian (the people who actually write most of the articles and make Wiki what it is). This is a concern, and it does not help with the admin clique perception some people have of English Wiki. This is a big concern. Something I have never come across in French Wiki. I wish Bbb23 all the best but I strongly oppose this nomination because I certainly do not want a clone of Drmies. I actually deal with African articles and some of which are senstive articles where everyone  (figuratively) appears to have an opinion but cannot point to Africa even if you give them a globe. No offense to Bbb23.

Per the sentiments of ϢereSpielChequers, and DGG (who actually took my unintentionally took some of my argument), I have to oppose. A lot of our articles contain unsourced content. The fact that we allow for it to exist is because we assume that someday some editor will come along and magically source the content, or the information being there is something which will help the average Joe discover something about something, and make a great discovery as a result (okay, maybe not this far, but I hope my point is being made). Some of the many edits that are made here add some very valuable material, for which there is literally no source that is acceptable, because it could be an oral history that is backed up by photographs, but not a book. I really feel uneasy about giving you the tools only because you have indicated that you might be more inclined to delete unsourced material than others, but that does not mean that I find fault in the rest of you. I look forward to working with you in the future, regardless of where you end up. At this point, I know that my vote won't change anything, but I do trust that you will take every vote to heart once you get the tools.'''Support''' - I've been impressed with Berean Hunter's work at SPI, where his insights and conclusions are typically spot-on, and it would be very useful for him to be able to push the buttons himself.

I admit to being a little concerned about Phil Bridger's diff, and I urge Crisco to go slowly in AFD and CSD where other editors have pointed out issues.

I am confident that any issues that may crop up can be dealt with via discussion, and that Crisco won't be the cause of any unnecessary drama. Also, I shouldn't neglect to mention his very impressive content contributions and his expertise in DYK. In my opinion it would be worth promoting him even if he only wanted the admin tools to work with the DYK queues. I think the project would definitely benefit from giving him a mop. — ''''''''Oppose'''. I'm sorry Crisco 1492.

The examples presented by Scottywong and Hegvald of CSD being misapplied are extremely concerning to me. Not just because they demonstrate poor knowledge of the criteria, which anyone working in that area really should be certain of, but they also present evidence of a cavalier attitude to deletion. Hegvald's diff in particular makes it clear that Dennis didn't even read the article beyond its first few words.'''Support''' - Regarding IAR, it's certainly a position not many editors take, but that doesn't make it any less valid.

Pretty much the only place I'd come across Jenks prior to this RFA was reading the pages related to the recent [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Rich Farmbrough|Rich Farmbrough Arbcom case]] , and I was distinctly unimpressed by his behavior there. Though there's no single diff I can point to and say "there, see?", and Jenks's presence hardly registered on the scale of "things that made that case angsty and generally unpleasant for all parties", commentary like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Rich_Farmbrough/Proposed_decision&diff=prev&oldid=491177457 this] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Rich_Farmbrough/Proposed_decision&diff=prev&oldid=490982386 this] give me the impression that in tense situations, Jenks might be more prone to poking people with a sharp stick than to attempting to defuse the situation, and to my mind, one of the biggest failures of our admin corps is that too many of its members seem to have been absent on the day they taught the class on "How not to inflame a situation". [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Rich_Farmbrough/Workshop&diff=prev&oldid=490611517 This comment] also gives me slight pause with regard to Jenks's apparent position on editing through full protection (though it may well be that I'm more conservative than the community in this, to me it reads as "editing through full protection is ok unless you have specific reason to think it will upset someone", which—again, ''to me'', perhaps I'm weird in this—indicates a possible tendency to wield admin powers in an unbecoming manner).<p>Those things said, however, everything else I'm seeing in my research about Jenks now checks out well, so though I'm opposing because my concerns about temperament are most important to me, I think Jenks would do a more than adequate job as an admin in other areas. Jenks, if this RFA passes, as it looks likely to do at the moment, I would suggest that you pay particular attention to your comments in heated situations. Be aware that what you say (and what I say, and what that other guy says...) has the power to affect a situation, and that what feels like blowing off steam or snarking a little bit to you/me/other dude can actually have a significant negative effect on the trajectory of a dispute.'''Support'''.

I would like to see this candidate expand further into other administrator actions that he is not so familiar with such as request for page protection and responding to the administrator's noticeboard upon the closure of this adminship.

If Jimbo could go around and "make a bunch of people who have been around for awhile sysops", why can't we do that?  Someone with no major problems in eight years is ridiculously unlikely to get himself involved in major problems after becoming an admin.  You can't be active here for eight years without getting into substantial problems if you're not admin material.'''Strong support''', this is precisely the kind of admin we need, and we've usually had no issues with them. I used to look for and nominate these kind of editors, and in my limited experience they turned out to be good admins. We shouldn't want to turn our content contributors into XfD people. Our content contributors should remain content contributors, that's where they're most needed. Adding the sysop flag to them is merely a way to let them help out in other parts of the wiki, should they desire to do so. This is a very good candidate and requirements of activity on admin areas are silly. Best of luck TommyBoy, and keep doing what you've been doing. <i><b>'''Oppose'''. I don't see this editor as admin material. I appreciate the polite demeanor and the no doubt sincere attempts at creating articles, but there is no indication that Tommy will be able to handle most of the duties of an admin, and I don't believe his article content skills are very good. I took an article at random ([[Kay A. Orr]]) from Tommy's list. Tommy indeed started the article, but his efforts were meager and subpar. Two other editors ([[User:Zigzig20s]] and [[User:SWMNPoliSciProject]]) actually improved the article, including sourcing it and creating a reasonable layout. I'm not impressed with the content Tommy added (the article was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kay_A._Orr&oldid=101136307 still unsourced many edits and two years after creation]) or the credit he's taken for doing so.--'''Oppose''' no doubt he won't wilfully misuse the tools, but new editors can be put off from continuing to contribute, and general disruption to the project can result, from inappropriate use of the tools (even if reversed quickly). In addition, administrators are looked on as being arbiters of consensus and policy - how can you do that if you aren't familiar with them? I'm not asking for anything much - just a few weeks of actively contributing to the relevant areas.  <font color="#E66C2C">'''Neutral''' - I'm leaning support, mostly for the same reasons as Dennis Brown states.  I'm not too concerned with the lack of experience in AIV, AfD, etc. per se, but I am concerned that some of the answers to the questions, especially 6 & 7 (but really 5-8) don't tell me much, and while I think TommyBoy has clue and would be a net positive with the mop, I would like to see a little more evidence of that with more explicit and detailed answers to jc37's questions before I commit to support.'''Support''' - "I say what it occurs to me to say when I think I hear people say things." This candidate sees his role as "trying to refine the dispute back to the essentials, try to broker an agreement on those essentials based on policy and common sense as much as possible, and then suggest overall solutions that match the core agreements. Really, it's just common sense....". A nutshell answer to what is an admin. ```Oh, yeah, I guess I support this editor too. <small>WK, please have the courtesy to not do something drastic again when I'm out camping! </small>'''Support''' Wow, excellent answers to the questions.

I can see no evidence of any experience of admin-related work in your editing history: anyone undertaking the job of an administrator has to have relevant experience.

Absent evidence that the candidate has a lack of respect for content editors, as opposed to having chosen to do other work, I don't see this as a reason not to support.'''Support''' - We always need more clueful admins working on vandalism.

Here, we have periodic spells of deleting articles created by sockpuppets of someone or other who's banned. If content creation is the be-all and end-all, why don't we welcome them?

However adminship responsibilities often take place out of article space. You have made no contributions to Wikipedia talk space and very few contributions to Wikipedia space. I simply don't see experience of vandalism fighting, dispute resolution, etc., which you claim are areas you where you want to contribute as an admin. Additionally, you were recently warned for personal attacks [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFarrtj&diff=502696037&oldid=502307575 here] for your conduct at [[Talk:ENFP]] in the Alicia Silverstone section. That doesn't inspire much confidence for me in your dispute resolution or communication skills, two important qualities for an admin. I could go on, however I think it's clear that, though you're a very productive editor in mainspace and have made numerous valuable contributions (>1000 on one article, and not just a bunch of little grammar fixes!), I don't think you're ready for adminship yet.'''Oppose'''.

What ultimately swayed me was SilkTork's comment. Making mistakes is okay, it happens to everyone. Mistakes, however, need to be treated as learning experiences, it isn't okay to pretend that mistakes were never made, and make no effort to remedy the situation.'''Strong Support''' Floydian is one of Wikipedia's most hard-working contributors, he really deserves the job and would do it well.

I'm not one who decries the occasional use of swear words (and I don't pretend I've never used any myself) or a robust approach (in fact, some of my favourite content creators are pretty robust), but I just don't think it's a suitable general approach for an admin - I think admins should aim to "talk softly, and carry a big mop". You do a lot of good work here, though, so this Oppose comes with a big helping of moral support for that - good content creators are worth far more than good admins. --'''Oppose'''  The Highway 401 article is beautifully written, and lacks only one essential ingredient.

I see from comments above that [[User:Floydian]] still persists in ownership, perceiving anyone with an alternative view as part of a 'cabal'. I'd love to stand Floydian a coffee and learn from him some of his editing tricks but until we see Highway 401 visible on Google maps I can't support this application.  --'''Oppose''' I was initially going to support, but after reading HJ's and Kudpung's reasons, I have to oppose.

I'm confident he can handle it.Moving to '''weak support''' since the candidate has explained the tyrannical comment to my satisfaction, the outburst against rschen seems to be a mild, isolated blow-up, and he has generally displayed a commendable attitude. Obviously, this support is pointless since the candidate needs 100 more to even get into the realm of possibly passing, but some support is needed.You haven't made a single edit to AIV, UAA, SPI, etc. I don't really see where the admin tools can be useful for you, and as Jasper said, ANI is a place you should probably stay away from if you can.

Unconvincing reasons for adminship. Little activity in admin-related areas.'''Oppose''' - [[User:Bmusician|Bmusician]] sums it up nicely.  Authoring skills are not the same as admin skills, and the candidate's handling of the pressures during this RfA make it clear they aren't ready to dive into messy situations that admins and even non-admins have to deal with daily.  They lack the restraint and basic communication skills that we would expect of any admin, and a lack of clue when it comes to policy and guidelines in general.

I still believe the admin who caused one of the incidents should have been desysopped in that case. Honestly I don't know how anyone else would have handled these situations. But it's way too soon after all this drama however. The nomination is very mistimed at best, especially that it's a self-nomination.

I'm somewhat concerned by the statement on blocks (Q5), which seems to be somewhat hasty, and by the statement on speedy deletions (Q8), which appears to see too much importance in these examples, especially the second.  However, I'm inclined to trust a nomination by Dennis, so I expect that LuK will edit in good faith and won't misuse the tools.

Ryan echos my sentiments entirely, in that you completely show a lack of understanding for CSD G5 and IAR, through your answers. A lot of those articles were expanded quite well by other users, even if they once had the kiss of death on them.

I find this user's attitude and prose sincere and believe he would make a good admin.  Unlike some of my fellow editors I'm less concerned with the experience than I am with the willingness to help and learn, and I've heard many times before that admins learn most of their role after being promoted.  While the low edit count does concern me, it appears to me that he will be proficient in the areas in which he wants to help.

Give it 6 months, listen to the other items you will hear this week, and prepare yourself mentally for the job.  I can't oppose, as I think you would likely curtail the incivility and wouldn't delete the main page, but I can't support yet either.'''Neutral''', I think the inexperience shows in some of the issues that have been pointed out here (and I won't belabor them). I certainly don't see anything unfixable here, though, and I'd look forward to being a couple sections up in a future RfA, since it seems the candidate is willing to carefully consider and take on board the criticism offered here.'''Neutral'''. Looks like a trustworthy user who would make a good administrator in the future. If this candidate gets more experience I will probably end up in the support column the next time around. Deleted contribs look good (love how I can check those now!), and judgement at AfD seems sound. The only gripe I have is that I would have liked to see more specifically policy-based arguments at AfD rather than assertions like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Christopher_Foltz&diff=465114703&oldid=465098504 this] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/2011_Virginia_Tech_shooting&diff=464961571&oldid=464949637 this].

Best — ''''''''Support''' as per Oppose #1... after all, every on this project knows that "cussing" in and of itself has been held by the community to be non-problematic - it's cussing ''at'' someone that is :-)  Now, seriously, the editor's contributions are far more than generally what we desire on this project.  Their attitude is far more than generally what we desire - with a little smartarsedness/self-mockery when and where required.  I'm convinced that they understand NOW how seriously we take the word "vandalism", and we'll see no more such issues.  Simply being a net-positive is never enough for me to support: this editor is well-beyond such, and appears to have learned significantly in this RFA as it is <span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">'''weak Oppose''' This ones tricky, I share Marshalls concern(s) as above. Having known other edtors ive talked in day to day life who stopped editing for this (acqusation of vandalism when good faith) reason, Im inclined to voice a weak oppose here'''Oppose''' because of the answer to question 10. Unless it's obviously being added in bad faith, such as blatant and serious BLP violations, there's no reason whatsoever to call any such revert "vandalism" per [[WP:NOTVAND]].--'''Oppose''' I am not comfortable with the thoughtless reverting. The appropriate approach is to do the research, or leave the content alone. Tag it, question the editor, or do some reading/research, but don't simply, unthinkingly, press the revert button. Removing [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|valid content]] is closer to vandalism than adding it. '''Difficult. I've seen MIpearc around, and like others, I've only seen positive things. The edit brought up by Warden doesn't concern me in the least &ndash; it's the idea that it's okay to call that vandalism. 'Vandalism' is a frightening word to a new user. How do they know what it is, or what they did wrong? Did they even know it was against policy to re-add their good-faith contribution? Sometimes we get so caught up in our own jargon that we forget that 'vandalism' is quite a serious thing in the real world, and it can never be fixed or 'reverted' with a simple mouse click. I'm on the fence (hence the neutral) and will probably return later to either stay here or support; regardless of the outcome, I'm confident that MIpearc will take the opposers' constructive criticism to heart in his/her future editing.'''Oppose''' Per all above comments, too inflammable to handle any stress that comes with the bit.'''Oppose''' I have seen you around and I think you have [[WP:CLUE]] in abundance.  You are bright, reasonable, rationale, and you explain your thoughts well.  However, what you lack is experience.  You mention you havent been in any major conflicts.  One of the things that comes with edit count is the probability that you'll end up in a major conflict.  I would like to see that day come and see how you handle yourself before granting the tools.  So a higher editor count is a must.  ~4000+ is what I'd like to see but I'd support a strong candidate with your attitude and level of [[WP:CLUE]] with ~2000+.  Another thing that comes with edit count is dedication.  We need to see that your dedicated to the project.  Another inactive admin (like this [[User:TParis]] asshole) isn't really useful.  I feel 6 months of strong activity (300 edits per month/10 edits per day) would show dedication.  Is this a volunteer project?  Yes, and those who wish to volunteer for the admin bit need to really want to volunteer.  The last thing that comes with edit count is experience with a variety of policies.  As someone else mentioned, you haven't created an article.  I would like to see some article creations.  Nothing major, I'm not a content writer either, but I would like to see experience with the notability guidelines.  You don't have to show yourself to be lax or strict with them, just that you know them and how to interpret then reasonably.  Participation at AFD (if you don't already) would also show some of this.  I could go on, nothing I have to say is a demark on you but rather a lack of factors which would make me comfortable to support.  Try again in six months to a year.--v/r -'''Oppose''' - not yet experienced enough. Good intentions, I'm sure, but it is not possible to gain the necessary experience with less than 200 edits to the article namespace, and as mabdul has pointed out, you have only made 11 mainspace edits in the last four months.'''Support''' Meh.  He likes to use big words.  Big deal.  We can't all be perfect; I'm sure we all have strange personality quirks.'''Oppose''' Seems like a good contributor, but communicating effectively and clearly is incredibly important as an administrator.'''Oppose''' - User comes across as pretentious. The nom statement and answers to the questions are eye-rolling. No thanks.Sorry, I'm wary of a candidate that makes RFA into a battleground  with the response to Q6: "The FA clan is a tight group that have a manner that ensures you will know if you've entered their house uninvited". Also, "On the other hand I can practically guarantee some will arrive here to oppose" is either a lack of good faith or a harbinger of future personality clashes as an admin.—'''Oppose''' Any serious contributor to the project needs to communicate clearly and effectively. As an admin, you may be expected to explain your actions to a frustrated user in a manner that is easily understood on a regular basis. Though you claim that your "style of writing considers first the audience", your style of writing feels out of place on Wikipedia (to me, at least). Your contributions are generally fabulous, as is your enthusiasm, but at this point I cannot support handing the mop to a user whose chosen method of communication is to engage in such a manner. Sorry.'''Oppose'''. The first time I came across My76Strat's writing style I thought that it must be some kind of experiment on the lines of the [[Sokal affair]], and nothing has since changed this opinion. I'm quite honestly amazed by some of the attempts by other editors above to dismiss this as a problem. There's no problem with using a wide vocabulary, including "big words", but the problem here is with the misuse of both vocabulary and grammar to the extent that most of what is written is either meaningless or ambiguous - the very opposite of academic writing, which some people seem to believe this is similar to. Obscurity and ambiguity may be fine for [[James Joyce|literary]] or [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|comedic]] effect, but are totally inappropriate for communication with colleagues in this workplace.'''Support''' - Yes, sometimes he uses too many words. Sometimes some of them are long ones. I see a huge improvement in communication style versus the previous RFAs, though, and I have no difficulty with his comments here (other than a couple of trypos). What I also see is a long term contributor, very keen to help. Helping is what admins are supposed to do. I'd rather have an admin with passion to do the right thing than another "head prefect" type wikilawyer. I think we have enough of those. After review I find absolutely no evidence this candidate would abuse any tools, and his commitment and experience demonstrate to me he wants to make things better, and can. Lastly - he's back here after his previous experiences, and has made great efforts to address perceived faults. That's a sign of commitment, right there. I offer him my respect for the way he has handled himself here. <span style="font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#000;">'''Oppose''' per Ironholds. And it isn't a question of "dumbing-down"; Malleus points out an instance where his unclear communication style actually exacerbated a situation unnecessarily. As a language freak I wasn't charmed by the two glaring errors in the nomination statement either. Use language clearly and well; we know your intentions are good. Come back after a few months of talking clearly and simply to others and you may get a different result. --'''Oppose''', unsurprisingly, since it's less than a month since [[Wikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2012_November_5#Wikipedia:IAR.|this charming exchange]].

As a side-note, I don't find the examples provided by Ironholds to be very problematic and have no issues with verbose language. <i><b>'''Oppose''' Normally I'd expect to do a little more of my own research before making a decision at RfA.

Sorry, but this sort of discourse appears completely incompatible with the way admins ought to conduct their communications. I've not found obvious evidence of any prior provocation between the candidate and [[User:Mogism]], which leaves me flummoxed. I'm also amused by the irony of the statement {{tq|I will instead '''ignore''' the wisdom within the rules}} (etc.)[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2012_November_5&diff=prev&oldid=521585953] when compared with the essay [[WP:Incorporate all rules|'''Incorporate''' all rules]].

That being said, some of the opposes raise legitimate concerns (though others frankly do not), and there are enough of them that the likely outcome here is a candidate with a better understanding of the issues he needs to address before coming back to this page in a few months. We recently had a candidate pass his second RfA by a near-unanimous margin after showing that he'd taken stock of the input her received in his first, unsuccessful one, and I am confident Pol430 can do the same.'''Oppose''' - Answers to q's 3, 9, and 12 reveal recent issues with [[WP:BITE]]--particularly problematic when the editor's primary admin interests are in AIV and CSD. —''''''''Thoughtful support''' As a project we are absolutely awful in supporting our experienced users as they approach burn out and high profile users are particularly susceptible to being thrown off the edge by a baying crowd as soon as a chink in their armour appears. I wouldn't presume to analyse PS' state of mind when they exploded so spectacularly in 2010 but as a former admin who often found the stress and burn out hard to handle myself I wouldn't be too harsh in applying a loss of trust argument for that reason alone. I do personally feel that towards the end of his time as Rlevse this user was too rule bound and unforgiving themselves for my taste as an admin but not to the point where they were outside the acceptable range of behaviours and once we accept that this user has learned a hard lesson about close paraphrasing the remainder of their contributions are impressive and a credit to the project. Given the aforementioned baying mob I certainly can't blame them for trying to restart under a new identity and this really does bring this RFA to a single question - was this user deserving of deopping at the time they flamed out. The answer to that is quite clearly no so I am bound to support now. That said, I would strongly suggest to PS that they stay at admin and don't take on any further advanced permissions or roles as once you have flamed out once that baying mob is always there in the sidelines with unlit torches and pitchforks at the ready. If this user is susceptible to wikistress than I hope his friends will do a better job helping him manage it this time round.'''Support'''  As per noms whom I respect.Prolific editor whose commitment and dedication to the project cannot be questioned.What a coincidence! Just earlier today I was thinking to myself, "I wonder if PumpkinSky will ever attempt to regain the sysop bit &mdash; that would be great for the project." In most RfAs, we are left with nothing but an editorial track record to gauge someone's suitability for the role of an administrator, but here we have the unusual benefit of already knowing whether or not promoting this user will be a net positive for the site. History bodes strongly in PumpkinSky/Rlevse's favour. He was an absolutely ''superlative'' administrator, and I am of the opinion that he should once again serve as a sysop. The close paraphrasing thing was a misunderstanding on his part (and a pretty common one at that), but he handled it quite well when all is considered. I haven't yet looked at the opposes, but my guess is that they're generally of the opinion that Rlevse has abused the trust of the community by socking around the issues with his prior account in attempting to have a clean start under a new username, and I understand their concerns, but I still don't feel as if anything he's done has reached the level where we should no longer have confidence in his abilities and his dedication to the project. Consider this a '''strongest possible support'''.All I can do is shake my head at the prospect that this RFA will pass easily (24-2 at the time I'm typing this) despite the candidate's colorful history, which the four lengthy nominations cheerfully shrug off. Anyone who wants to educate themselves about the candidate should take a trip through Rlevse's talk page history; I could dig up the links I remember about this candidate and post them here, but it seems pointless. It's fine for this editor to come back to edit, but returning the bit strikes me as insane.'''Oppose''' per the numerous instances of poor judgement. The plagiarism itself was forgiveable, but not the subsequent events. Someone with an admittedly weak understanding of copyvios shouldn't have returned to editing anonymously.'''Oppose''' I very much appreciate the forthright answer to my question.  However, there are several problems.  Plagiarism is one.   Though I believe the candidate has atoned for it I still think doing it in the first place disqualifies from a position of trust, especially since he had criticized others for doing it when he was an arbitrator.  Battleground behavior and sockpuppetry during his block are also very concerning.  Another observation I made as long-term Arbcom lurker was that Rlevse as an arbitrator usually voted his personal prejudices on cases without considering conflicting evidence, context, or nuance.  I could provide a raft of details, but the first transcendental meditation and climate change cases are prime examples.  As an admin he blocked editors who had content disputes with his friends.  I accept that PS does not intend to run for arbcom again, but a basic property of adminship is some sort of eventual involvement with dispute resolution, and I don't have much confidence in his fairness.  Finally, and this is little fault of the candidate, there has been a strong whiff of back-room dealing and off-wiki collusion in the events leading from his unblocking without consensus straight through to this RFA.  Carrite alludes to this above.  I cannot place any confidence in a process that emerges from a [[smoke-filled room]].  With regrets,'''Oppose'''. I'm concerned that some of those commenting here are attempting to minimise the problems with Grace Sherwood's TFA. For one thing the copyright/plagiarism issues were ''not'' minor, they were quite significant, and for another Rlevse and others tried to divert the blame onto me, for not having checked the sources during a copyedit; I don't consider that to have been an honest thing to do. I'm also unhappy about the shenanigans surrounding the FAC director earlier this year, in which PumpkinSky was involved along with at least one of his nominators.'''Oppose''' - Way too many problems in his past.  I would never trust him with the tools again.'''Neutral''' - Though it's been a few years, I had an unpleasant encounter with PB89 over a minor mistake I made about the name of a street--including assumptions of bad faith and borderline incivility. Though I was surprised recently that I agreed with his attempt to AfD [[Occupy Ashland]], I'm not seeing that his temperment has improved much over the years. Although I don't think he will abuse the tools, civility is as important in an admin as other skills and he needs to improve in this area.'''Support:''' Generally happy with answers to questions.  The people nominating also have good reputations, and their trust in this candidate makes me feel more comfortable. --Long editing history with no dead bodies and no trace of Chuck Woolery. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">'''Support'''—while the paraphrasing is a concern, I feel that QuiteUnusual has and will continue to learn from the concern it has raised. <span style="white-space:nowrap;">{&#123;'''Oppose''', [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rebel_%28film%29&diff=prev&oldid=519189703 this edit summary] and various similar ones show a misunderstanding of what constitutes [[WP:VANDAL|vandalism]] that would be troubling in an admin dedicated to fighting vandalism.'''Oppose''' Fairly certain this will flunk [[WP:NOTNOW]] when a bold editor or admin chooses to close it.

I was hoping to support this, as Rcsprinter looks like a decent editor and a nice bloke, and I've seen him around the place doing good things. It would also be a great help to have another editor answering protected edit requests. I had a look at Rcsprinter's CSD tagging, though, and I'm a bit concerned. (Note: I didn't look at any of the file tagging, only article tagging, as files aren't my strong point.) <p>The A7 tagging was fine, but Rcsprinter has a tendency to tag articles for A3 when they have been created but then blanked by their creator. This happened with [[Tor henrik larsen]] and [[Tor hagalid]], both on May 22, and again on August 1 with [[Shram Laboratories]]. (Shram Laboratories is a borderline case depending on what you count as "chat-like comments" per [[WP:A3|CSD A3]], however - the content was one sentence in the first person starting with "My name is ...".) Every revision of an article has to qualify for a CSD criterion for the article to be deletable under that criterion, and this isn't the case for the three articles here, particularly the two tagged on May 22. They were all acceptable [[WP:G7|G7]] candidates, however, and have been deleted as such.</p> <p>More concerning than those is a tag on July 27 of [[How to eat a coconut]], a short recipe for making coconut. This was PRODded by another editor, and after that Rcsprinter tagged it with {{tlx|db-g6}}, a technical deletion, with Twinkle's standard edit summary and no extra explanation. This page falls under [[WP:NOTHOWTO]], but being a how-to is not a speedy deletion criterion. I don't think this page qualifies under any of the speedy deletion criteria, and I would have declined the speedy altogether. (In the end it was deleted under A10.) It certainly didn't fall under [[WP:G6|G6]], which is only supposed to be for completely uncontroversial deletions. After seeing these tags, and seeing that Rcsprinter wants to work in CSD, unfortunately I must oppose. — ''''''''Some ''Oppose'' this is''' per [[User:The ed17|Ed]], [[User:Wizardman|<span style="color:#030">'''''Wizardman'''''</span>]], [[User:EatsShootsAndLeaves|<font style="color:#ffffff;background:black;">dangerous</font>]][[User talk:EatsShootsAndLeaves|<font style="color:#000000;background:white;">panda</font>]], [[User:Cyberpower678|<font color=green face=Neuropol>cyberpower]] and [[User:Reaper Eternal|Reaper Eternal]].

That said, in the midst of this RfA the fellow has the integrity to stick his neck out and take issue with the excessive length of a block on another user, and the chutzpah to put the blocking admin right on several key points. Good enough for me. We need more like this.'''Support''' So far as I can judge in cases like this we simply cannot tell at RFA whether or not people will become adequate admins. However, I don't like it when people prepare for RFA by behaving in an obsequious way.

Thanks. These were designed to establish a couple of things; first to see if the candidate knows when to stop flogging a dead horse and second to determine what hastened their decision to present for RFA. The second point has been fully answered by the candidate and supported by their respected nominator. I expect an Admin candidate to have good content development experience, clear knowledge of policy, the support of editors who’s opinions I respect and a manner & style which demonstrates their ability to convince editors to modify their position when dealing with disputes. I encountered this candidate in a discussion relating to a proposition to introduce minimum edit thresholds for RFA candidates. He was a leading advocate. I challenged the proposal, as indicated in Q5. The ability to recognise when you are wrong is important for all of us. Entrenched views are at the heart of most disputes and the ability of an Admin to see all points of view and persuade intransigent editors towards an alternative is essential. That requires sound judgement. If the candidate cannot be convinced to drop their support of such a poor, intellectually deficient idea as minimum edit thresholds I do not consider their judgement to be yet adequate.'''Oppose''' - Less than 12 months experience is too little. Not now, perhaps later. Seems like a sensible user who be later be trusted with the mop, ''after'' more experience. ~The self-nomination statement was unhelpful and undescriptive. One would presume that a serious admin candidate is requesting tools to help with administrative tasks. [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2011 Virginia Tech shooting]] was opened less than four hours after the creation of the article in question, which strikes me as hasty. In addition, I'm concerned that someone who wasn't familiar with the RfA process until only a few weeks ago is going to take the admin job poorly. RfAs, like adminship in general, can end up being very personal and I don't know if the candidate is prepared for the inevitable and unfortunate barrage of criticism that I suspect is coming soon. But I'm open to persuasion. Impress me. <span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:80%;">'''/'''Oppose''' I'm afraid I have to oppose Sven Manguard - User is not civil.There is a complain against the user for making personal attacks [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_permissions/File_mover#User_Sven_Manguard_making_personal_attacks here].'''Oppose''' - you need to show some maturity as an editor, especially with respect to policies.

The matter discussed in DoriSmith's question concerns me, but seems to be an isolated incident—and one through which I hope the candidate will learn that retaining new content writers is unspeakably important.'''Oppose''' I've had mixed feelings about this one since it started, because I believe that we're desperately low on admins. However, I have to come in against promoting SwisterTwister because, imo, he just doesn't appear to be particularly interested in adminship. I base this on his few to no edits at UAA, AN, ANI, and AIV (two of which he listed as places where he'd like work). Additionally, while he has a ton of edits in UT space, there's only a handful he's edited more than twice. The avoidance of conflict, as previously noted, makes it impossible to know what he would be like as an admin. He says he wants to work at CSD, but as he doesn't keep a CSD Log, there's no way of knowing what we could expect from him there. His answers to the questions are truly sad; he never fully answered my question (#6), and the answer to #8 is just plain worthless. When asked at #14 about his lack of experience with content disputes, his answer showed he doesn't even know what content disputes are. (I guess with all these negatives, it's really telling that I'm still torn—that's how badly I think we need admins). SwisterTwister, I know plenty of people have said to come back in 6-12 months; imo, you should consider re-running when 3-5% or so of your edits are to article talk space. <span style='font:1.0em "Apple Garamond","Adobe Garamond Pro",Garamond,serif;color:#369;'>'''Neutral''' This user has good and bad traits.

Back in 2006/2007-ish, it was quite common for admins to be approved even if they hadn't met the 6-month requirement (that many users independently held) if the user had shown trustworthiness, diversity of experience, etc., and nothing truly horrific ever came of any such exceptions being made.'''Support''' Sorry for late vote, I totally missed it was 7K (hit "earliest" as opposed to "older 500".'''Oppose'''. I  had a feeling  this RfA would be coming. While I heartily join with all those who  have praised Theopolism's enthusiasm and engagement  for Wikipedia, I am also 'old school' (''very'' old for some...) and must reiterate True Silver's concerns about the CVU Academy that it '' 'speaks more of treating Wikipedia like a social networking site than an encyclopedia' ''. I  have commented several times that I find the CVU project has become unnecessarily bureaucratised and has introduced pseudeo hierarchies and leaderships. Such pursuits appear (to me at least) often as stepping stones for hat-collecting where it should be clearly understood that user rights are not rewards for good work.  That said, I  encourage Theo  to  keep  up  his good work, but he does not yet meet all [[User:Kudpung/RfA criteria|my RfA criteria]], and I'm not sure he has read [[WP:Advice for RfA candidates|'''this''']]; its reading is of course not mandatory, but I feel it may have prevented what here is, IMHO, an RfA a tad too early.'''Oppose''' for now, but willing to support a future RfA. You joined about a year and a half ago, but only started editing heavily in April of this year. Sorry, but I don't think you have enough experience just yet. You're definitely a valuable contributor, though, so keep on doing what you're doing (maybe do a little more contet work but that decision's up to you) and if you come back here in <s>six</s> eight months or so you will probably have my support. Regards,'''Oppose'''. As I've said before, amdinship is not merely about mashing button, and if it were the Foundation would simply hire a group of moderately intelligent monkeys. Adminship is about judgement, and Theo currently exhibits almost precisely the opposite of the judgement and maturity I expect of an administrator. His talk page would seem to suggest that he, or at least his friends, are more concerned with the social aspect of Wikipedia than with the business of building an encylcopaedia and he seems to make hasty decisions, which can result in sloppy work. This is evidenced perfectly by the nomination statement in this very RfA and by [[Special:Undelete/How_to_fix_a_broken_ignition_cylinder_lock_on_a_Ford_F150_pickup|this incident]] {{small|sorry, admins only}}. This combined with the relatively short tenure compels me to oppose. Theo, you have the potential to be a good admin, but I think you need another year or so's experience first.'''Tepid oppose''' - I concur with {{User|TheSpecialUser}} and with other editors above me (e.g. <small>{{User1|CharlieEchoTango}}, {{User1|StephenBuxton}}</small>). Maybe in the next few months or so he will be a suitable candidate for Adminship, but it really is too soon. BTW, there is no shortage of Admins in wikipedia. Most are worthy some are just not. I personally feel, the fewer admins, the better.'''Moral support''' - [[WP:NOTNOW|Not right now]], I really think four months of active editing isn't a good enough time period to decide, even with as many edits as you have racked up in such a short period of time. I see nothing to make me oppose, however, so I hope you apply again when you have a year or so of experience - if you keep the same editing pattern, there wouldn't be any reason for me not to support.

While most administrative actions will be entirely boring, the ones that draw fire are those where there is some protracted dispute. I like administrators who have been involved in disputes instead of simply avoiding them. Reverting vandalism without warnings.

However, we don't have half a mop, just a full one, so I think it's necessary that applicants have '''some''' experience in all areas. In this case I see almost zero vandal fighting, and vandalism is a serious part of admins work (and the few warnings I have looked up have been warning1 when warning1 is already on the page) - I cannot even suggest some time with [[WP:HG|huggle]] as that requires a rollbacker attribute, and we haven't yet seen enough vandal fighting to be able to give you that - which you would gain if this application went through.

When tagged it already had content, references (albeit not showing due to cite error) and the album chart. A better option than tagging would have been to fix the {{T|Reflist}}  issue. The 100edit user who created the article would still have been trying to find out white the cite error meant while you were tagging it. I can forgive a few errors, even relatively recent ones as long as they are rare. The best I can do for the project is raise this here and hope that you (and other potential candidates) take this on board and improve new article review because of it.

I've bumped into HJ Mitchell on several occasions over the past year, and I've never found him to be anything but transparent and fair.  Kind of person we need as an admin: he's good now, and he's only going to get better.  As a sacrificial offering, I suggest we vote someone else off the admin island.  Nominees?'''Support''' I think currently admin rights are taken too seriously and are too difficult to remove and that means admin issues become more painful than they should be to sort out - which is definitely bad for the project. Re-going through an RfA seems like a reasonable way of avoiding that problem, and if it was widespread then not too much face would be lost if anyone needed to be persuaded into doing so. With regards to this specific case HJ Mitchell has always come across as a good admin to me and has generally used his powers well so I support. --'''Support''' Absolute support, without reservation, derived from personal observations, and interactions with HJ.'''Strong support''' -- Hard working, always out in front, willing to take a chance when others operate in the realm of great caution.

I don't care for the somewhat high handed manner this admin adopts in his dealings with others. Franamax is also persuasive here. In the interests of transparency I should note that my first account here on WP was blocked by HJ as a username violation.(moved from "Waste of Time" (neutral)) This idiotic re-confirmation is a waste of everyone's time. You know as well as anyone that there is no reason to take adminship away from you, yet you go through with this anyways. What was your point, exactly? Was your judgement so skewed that you thought that the result would be anything different than the obvious one? If your judgement is that skewed, then you shouldn't be an admin. Or, if not that, was this just to help enlarge your ego, seeing all of the people that supported you? If so, I most certainly don't want to be a part of that. Up until this RfA, I thought you were a fantastic admin, and I would have thought anyone crazy that tried to get you de-sysopped. However, the fact that you really thought it necessary to waste everyone's time with this idiotic RfA, so that you couldenlarge your ego seeing over a hundred people support you, has led me to decide that you should not get the bit back. [[WP:ADREV]] would have been a much better option, and nobody would have thought less of you for it. ~~'''Support''' per HJ Mitchell.

I did vote support previously at his [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Ironholds 3|third RfA]], and I'm sticking with supporting this time round as well, even if we (probably) don't always agree - though I do think he's answers to question 13 were fair. The oppose that got be closest to not supporting was that by WereSpielChequers (who I have also met for real), and I agree with him that a level 4im warning was a bit hasty here, but I'm willing to forgive this providing that Ironholds takes the feedback on board.'''Oppose''' I like Ironholds, I've met him at several meetups, and I'm happy to agree with almost everyone on this page that he is a great contributor. But not all great contributors are suitable for adminship. I'm not too concerned about Colonel Warden's oppose, April 2010 is a long while ago and any editor is capable of changing greatly in that time. Nor do I share Short Brigade Harvester Boris's concern - commitment to the project is in my view  a good thing and multiple RFAs are perfectly OK, provided the candidate reacts to the reasons why people have opposed. But I'm not really comfortable with Ironholds having the delete button and block buttons. The incident I've queried in Question 15 is too recent. As is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Buffalo_Kill&diff=prev&oldid=400660368 this, where Ironholds jumped in straight with a level 4 warning, and I'm still wondering whether it was vandalism or a good faith attempt to rename an article by cut and paste.] Both of these imply to me that the reasons why Ironholds has previously been thought unsuitable for adminship are still current. Would Ironholds be the sort of admin to ignore consensus and go off on an out of process deletion spree? Hopefully not, but I do suspect he would be too quick with both the block and delete buttons, so with great reluctance I must oppose. '''''Neutral''' Given that the problems identified by others (SoWhy mainly) are fairly serious and in an area I care about (deletion) I'm leaning toward oppose.

Contrary to some of my wikifriends' views, I see no reason an admin should have a stellar record in article writing. The skill-base can overlap with the kind of admin protection we need, but in many ways it does not.No one has brought up any trust issues in the template work Jimp is doing already. Given his record, I also trust him to either confine himself to that area or be cautious in expanding his use of admin tools.--'''Support''' This is a judgment call. I think on the balance that he'll learn to do it well, and will correct his mistakes when they are pointed out to him. Usually I think it best for someone to learn a little more first, & show it by a longer record,  but this is close enough. When in doubt,  I go a lot by how someone handles the AfD, and I think he's doing it right.    ''''''Support'''. On the one hand, the candidate is going to contribute in a specific area for which he is extremely well qualified, and where there is a need. On the other hand, per the kinds of issues that are discussed in Jim Miller's oppose, I ask myself what the risks might be if, hypothetically, the candidate later decides to move into other administrative areas. Given how long he has been here with a clean block log, and with no evidence of drama that I can find by going back over his talk history, I figure that the risks are low. Thus, a clear net positive. --'''Support'''. I've had nothing but great experiences working with him. ♫'''Support''' - I have been watching this one for a while trying to figure out where to land.  I have some concerns but I don't think those concerns out weigh the good so this is where I end up.'''Weak Support'''. I've looked at that Q3 set of diffs and thought pretty hard about them. My reading of the original post by the candidate is that it actually was ''not'' a request for medical advice, but rather, a request for information beyond what was found in a search engine search, but it was poorly expressed in a manner that could very easily be misread as a request for medical advice. Not a great performance, and disturbingly recent, but not as bad as it has been made out to be, and the candidate drew attention to it himself. I don't see editors here showing evidence that it has been part of an ongoing pattern. It seems too much of a single event to rise to the level of a deal breaker. Frankly, I'd rather see more maturity and more content experience, but I end up feeling on balance that I trust the candidate to be an administrator. Please don't prove me wrong. --'''Oppose'''. Candidate has not committed to a term limit or to specific recall criteria. Sorry. No other concerns. --'''Neutral''' Do not oppose for 1 little incident, but its true that your answer to Q3 is worrisome.  ~~'''Weak support''' He seems to be good at adminship but he already has lots of groups so he could do enough.  ~~'''Awsome''''''Support''' A well experienced editor, time to give home the mop.

The (apparent) opinion that an essay on notability for schools trumps the GNG seems not only odd (and frankly mistaken), that whole discussion seemed off to me.  I can live with the notion that he didn't find the sources in the AfD in question strong enough, but that (very recent) quote really bothers me.  His answer to my question didn't really clarify anything for me.  That said, I'm seeing a highly active and helpful editor who does a lot of great things.

As well as expertise and an outstanding history of contributions - as Kudpung has - admins need the self confidence to admit it when they're wrong.'''Oppose''' I think Sandy is right on the money despite backing off her own statement.  I'm concerned that the comments she quotes demonstrate an eagerness to be awarded and then the candidate insisting they dont want awards even skipping their own graduation seems to be some deep inner thing against recognition that is hiding a need for recognition.  I am trying not to make this a personal attack, the candidate seems like a great editor and I have nothing against him personally.  I simply feel there is something below the surface that Sandy may have scratched at.  I feel slightly deceived by the candidate for these reasons which is why I am forced to oppose.  I dont expect the candidate to come out and say "You're right, I really love awards" but the candidates actions of posting those awards at the top of his talk page seem to contradict his words.  They appear to say "Hey, look at these before disagreeing with me.  I've received all these awards."  I'm not against award pages at all or keeping barnstars, I keep three on my own userpage.  I am only concerned that they were placed at the top of his talk page.  Sorry to Kudpung if my words were hurtful, I only wanted to explain my rationale.--v/r -'''Changed from oppose to neutral.''' I'm changing my !vote, because it is apparent that Kudpung is taking to heart the various concerns that have been discussed in this RfA. I haven't deleted the comments I made under "Oppose" (above). --'''Neutral''' – My original opinion of Oppose was too harsh of an assessment.  Clearly an editor that is experienced, technically proficient and an admirable contributor.  However concerns with temperament hold me back from supporting at this time. <font face="Times New Roman">'''Support'''. As Boing! said above, JamesBWatson provided an excellent reasoning, that I can only agree on. I have to say, I find opposes because of less-than-stellar grammar in Q3 especially concerning. If the candidate's comments are understandable, then they communicate good enough to be an admin. We can't all be grammar experts (I certainly am not and still no one ever complained that they don't understand my comments because of their grammar). Regards ''''''Support'''. Not seeing any compelling arguments in Oppose. Content creation is not a key criterion for adminship for me. A single close-paraphrased sentence is not enough to push me to oppose; a grammatical error in an RFA response, even less so. Candidate seems to have been acting like an admin without problems for some time, so let's give him the chance to provide further benefit here.Lear's Fool becoming an admin will make it more likely that my children remain fed. There is a shortage of admins working the Australian afternoon timeslot, which LF will fill. Because of that shortage I often find myself lured into performing administrative tasks from work, thus increasing the chance of me being [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boned boned <sup>(no. 6)</sup>] and my family going hungry. But in all seriousness, LF is a good editor who will make for a good admin. The opposes raise concerns that are reasonable. Communication is important and if there's any more evidence of close paraphrasing I'd reconsider. But they're outweighed by the good. --'''Support''', the answers to question 8 and 9, especially, show that the candidate is thoughtful and capable of handling a difficult situation. After reviewing the opposes, I find them...wanting, to put it as tactfully as I possibly can. Spot checking the candidate's edits doesn't reveal any recent red flags or misconduct.'''Support''' - The Opposers don't make a convincing case.  James B Watson, Kingturtle, Wifione and many others do.  I cast this !vote with the observation that support is currently at 73%, and in hopes that more Supporters will step forward.  Again, the burden is on Opposers to make a strong case for not giving Lear's Fool the extra buttons, and I am not seeing it below.  My best wishes to the candidate and thanks for the service to the encyclopedia.'''Strong oppose''', moving from neutral. In my comments under neutral, I note that there was a lot to like about Lear's Fool, but I expressed concern at lack of detailed work on content and questioned Lear's involvement in efforts to form consensus about content.  Lear's answer to my question 11 makes it clear that he has no intention of making significant contributions to content, and that alone rules him out in my book: unless administrators are well-grounded in the hard work of content creation and consensus-building, they are ill-equipped to understand the issues faced by editors who ''do'' create content (without whom Wikipedia is pointless). However, even without that content-aversion, the three discussions listed would have been enough to switch me to oppose: in [[Talk:Mike Rann/Archive2#Recent_Polls]], Lear fails to understand [[WP:SYN]]; in [[Talk:Kevin Rudd#Image]] he tries to settle the issue on a headcount despite the strength of argument against the leading option, which still has only minority support; and in [[Talk:Isobel Redmond#Evans_Family]] Lear raised a [[WP:V]] issue which was already covered in one of the refs [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/redmond-takes-a-step-to-the-right-in-party-wrangle/story-e6frgczx-1225851728462]. The BLP concerns were laudable, but misplaced.<br />Lear, your conduct is consistently civil and thoughtful, and oozes good faith, but what I have seen here persuades me that you have far too little knowledge of policy and experience of content-creation to make a suitable admin ''at this point''.  I fear that could easily lead you to make well-intentioned but unpleasant errors in the use of the tools; for example I really don't like the idea of you closing an XfD based on the principles you applied to the Rudd's photo discussion.  So while your character is just what I like to see as an admin, I would hate to see you get the tools unless and until you have learnt more about policy and content-creation. --'''Support''' In patrolling (then) and CSD deleting (now), and in AfD, I see MQS around. Very often rescuing something I would have thought past help. And also voting 'delete'. If he does that, I am sure whatever it is is definitely past help of any other sort. He may have "not done any Patrol yet" as such, but, by heck, he's been around in there and knows what's what.'''Support''' Excellent contributions and in improving the encyclopedia. No concerns here. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">'''I supported last time and clearly MQS has only become a better editor since then, so this is pretty obvious for me. --'''Support''' I feel an admin needs experience, courtesy and necessary toughness to prevent vandalism or mistreatment of articles. MQS displays all those. '''''support''' no reason to think that this user would abuse the tools.  --'''Support'''.  Candidate was both extremely helpful and civil in a recent AFD discussion.  He assumed good faith, made a rebuttal, and waited for the nom (me) to do the right thing.  It was only after browsing his talk page when we started discussing the episode that I learned of his RFA.  Good guy!'''Support'''. What I see here is someone who is readily willing to listen and learn, and who is conducting himself admirably through an excess of grilling in this RfA. --'''Support''' Some amazing edits. Some good article creations. Talk page interactions seem well too. – <font face="Arial" color="CornflowerBlue">'''Support''' I would oppose if there is a mistake this editor has made, but when there are lack of edits in the Wikipedia and talk space, this isn't the case. Other important thing is, the editor likes to start slowly (i.e. on one area) which is a good start for an administrator. I'm pleased that the expected outcome of this area would be a lot of "Thank you" based comments. These are the several reasons why I support this candidate.'''Support''' Incredibly prolific, good communication, experienced in applying policy and a clear rationale. Both deserving of greater responsibility and capable of exercising it wisely.Over 100,000 edits ... and less than 1,000 of them to the project or projectalk namespaces?

The only hesitation that I have here is lack of edits in Wikipedia and User talk namespaces; and a general lack of experience in the traditional admin. areas (e.g. vandal fighting).--'''Neutral''' - Many edits but relatively few in areas where the admin tools would be used, and more experience in those areas would be preferred before getting the tools.--'''Support'''. Erudite, articulate, and no red flags that I can find. --'''Neutral''' Although I see lots of good work, especially with CSD tagging. There is very little evidence of real vandal fighting (often the main thrust of admin work) - indeed the user has the rollback facility, but the use of that seems very limited - the number of automated edits is zero - I don't remember a recent successful RfA with zero (someone's bound to put me right..). Having said that I can see that this is a well respected editor, with obviously a lot of trust, and I therefore doubt if they will abuse that trust, so even though my initial thoughts were oppose, I'll keep it neutral for now. '''I '''Support''' a candidate who wants to help out with backlogs.'''Support''' - Experienced and trustworthy, the candidate's more than 20,000 edits includes 10 new articles and 11 redirects. A terrific vetting statement by nom is also a feather in this candidate's cap.--'''Watchlisted support''' I've been waiting for this!  Qwyrxian is a very discerning editor whose edits display a thorough knowledge of policy and consensus as well as good communication skills.  I have no doubt that he would put the mop to good use. ''''''Support''' Qwyrxian has the skills and the temperament. To me, what is most important in an admin, is a level head and thoughtful decisions. Qwyrxian demonstrates this in every edit.

Easy decision - I've seen Qwyrxian around the place a lot, and recently we've started working in the same area (articles related to India) where there has been a lot of unpleasantness. If Qwyrxian can handle that and stay focused and calm, I have no doubts about any other areas.

While he can be quite naive when it comes to dealing with inter-personal disputes, he appears to have as much admin quality as anyone can possibly have. --'''Support''' - Level headed editor. Giving him admin tools will be a net positive to the project--'''Support''' Answer to question regarding the ridiculous CSD candidate does, indeed, tell me Qwyrxian understands CSD, Steven Walling's (still) confusion of process with results notwithstanding. --'''Support''' - can't see any reason to oppose - give him a mop!'''Support''' I've bumped into this editor a few times and found them to be clueful and helpful. Having read the opposes, they range from things I feel are not major issues to things I outright disagree with, but I see nothing that might waiver my support.

I found Qwyrxian's edits to be meaningful and trustworthy.Seems to be a reasonable editor, I can't think of any significant interaction I've had with him/her but a look at contributions show a grounded and reasonable approach. &mdash;'''Oppose''' on the basis of continuing misunderstanding of speedy deletion. It's not a question of the interpretation of "credible" and "significant", about which people can reasonably differ, but a continuing refusal to limit A7 to the types of articles for which it was intended. The schools problem has been mentioned, and the dog problem is also either not perceiving that this is not an individual animal, or   deciding it didn't matter and A7 can apply to whatever one might want it to despite the continuing strong consensus that the categories are meant as a strict limitation. I'm open to changing my !vote here if there is an adequate explanation.   ''''''Oppose'''. Qwyrxian has done a lot of contributions to wp and I would say he (or maybe she) is a very productive wiki editor, and even may be more, an industrious wiki Online Ambassador. But I do not think he is qualified as an administrator now. He is still far away from wiki adminiship because he has quite often misconstrued or misinterpreted wiki's important policies and guidelines, particularly the most important the NPOV one. The maybe-well-known-disputed page [[Senkaku Islands]] and its relative pages was led to a mediation recently for its name/title dispute and debate. Based on the spirit, policies, and guidelines of Wikipedia, I raised that "[[Wikipedia talk:Requests for mediation/Senkaku Islands#Wikipedia shall not be forced to take side when involving international territory dispute|Wikipedia shall not be forced to take side when involving international territory dispute]]". His answer was "Of course Wikipedia takes sides". When the precedent [[Liancourt Rocks]], which is demonstrated as a typical example in the wiki guideline [[WP:NCGN#Multiple local names]], was mentioned, he indiscreetly asked "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_mediation/Senkaku_Islands&diff=434174679&oldid=434172139 Please drop it]" and then actually shut a door or way as a possible dispute resolving approach. The naming disputes over the page [[Senkaku Islands]] and its relative pages have lasted so long (a couple years) and Qwyrxian has actively played an important role there. Qwyrxian's "contributions" including tricks like "penny wise and pound foolish" on these disputes bear important responsibilities for the disputes last so long including the recent failed mediation. As for his such atitude towards wiki's NPOV, I am afraid if Qwyrxian is empowered with adminiship, he may make Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, becoming, at least in some parts or aspects, the pro-Japan or pro-whateverbiased encyclopedia. Qwyrxian should learn more in this important aspect from other administrators including admin [[user:Magog the Ogre|Magog the Ogre]]. --<b>Oppose</b> I have very limited interaction with this editor.  I thought better of a comment I made and chose to remove it to avoid escalating an editing dispute. Qwyrxian not only restored it, ensuring it was read but templated me for removing my comments. This demonstrates to me that he has poor judgement in managing disputes and doesn't have what it takes.'''Support'''. RfAs basically boil down to the question: "do you trust this candidate?". Usually, I like to see a bit more edits: it's not mere editcountitis, but a way to reasonably evaluate if the admin candidate is clueful enough not to screw up; that's why I'd also like to see that an admin candidate is experienced in admin-related areas, because even good-faith mistakes can have serious consequences (admin actions can be easily undone, but their consequences cannot; a blocked newbie can be unblocked, but if he's been scared away, we've probably lost him for good). In this case, however, despite the low number of edits in general and in admin-related areas in particular, I believe this user has demonstrated through his demeanour that he's calm, level-headed and clueful enough to avoid using the button in the areas he doesn't have enough experience in or in cases where he's not certain. And I also agree with Mkativerata: {{xt|If Rami is going to use the tools once a week, and use them well: good. It's better than not at all.}} [[WP:TL;DR]], For all these reasons, I believe this user can be trusted with a few more buttons. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml">  ''''''Support''' I don't have any doubts that he'd abuse the tools and has been really helpful with RfPP.

I do share the concerns about light participation in the deletion processes – I think more involvement as a participant would be advisable prior to diving into closing them, although the comments the candidate has made so far at AfD are quite sensible.

However I am very concerned by the professed interest in getting involved in CSDs. The candidate does not appear to have much experience with CSDs, and admin actions related to CSDs are virtually impossible for non-admins to review and I don't know how much checking goes on by other admins, but I gather not much.

My interactions with Sarek in an administrative capacity have been largely positive. I see no reason to take away his sysop bit. —'''Support'''. This wasn't as obvious to me as HJ's reconfirmation, as Sarek has clearly been involved in a fair amount of drama. Looking through ANI archives, I've found no less than 7 incidents brought up regarding him specifically along with all sorts of accusations all over the place, including demands for de-sysop at places like ARBCOM. However, you haven't been de-sysoped, the ANIs were closed without incident and [[WP:Requests for comment/SarekOfVulcan]] is a red link. What's more, the fact that he have put himself up for this, knowing his own history and that "enemies" would come out woodwork, the fact that he pretty much [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive650#Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive650|INISISTED]] on being [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=&page=User%3ASarekOfVulcan&year=&month=-1&tagfilter= blocked] for a mistake, implies to me that he trying to do the right thing.

I think I'm with Pedro here, but I don't wish to speculate on the precise reasons for this 'RfA'. I think Sarek is a fine administrator who has the courage to make sometimes difficult decisions. Scott Mac's oppose, below, has merit as well, but "If you can't judge for yourself..." is not, in my opinion, the proper assessment: I don't think the issue is that Sarek can't judge for themselves. The whole INVOLVED thing, from what I saw of it (which probably isn't everything, unfortunately), is overblown. And if (per Pedro) Sarek is an attention seeking whore, well, slap them with a perfumed trout. So, support, get back to work, and let there be a timely end to this thing.'''Support'''  I've always found Sarek responsible with the tools and he has my support.--'''Support '''- sure, some things could have been done better, but could this not be said of all of us.

A clear net positive as an admin, despite the concerns over [[WP:INVOLVED]]. The furore over Sarek saying he "wouldn't object to an early closure" is a storm in a teacup, and doesn't reflect on Sarek's competency as an admin. Any admin who makes it their policy to make tough block decisions is going to generate a hefty amount of opposition at a reconfirmation RfA. That Sarek knew this and went ahead anyway, clearly demonstrates that he values the community's opinions on his behaviour, more than he values his adminship. I think that's an indication that he can be trusted. In addition, although his way of saying it clearly doesn't satisfy a substantial minority of !voters, he obviously does take the concerns expressed seriously, and I think has learned from them. An addition - in my view a number of Opposes should be disregarded as they specifically state they are Opposed ''solely'' because this is a reconfirmation RfA; that's a groundless Oppose when this RfA clearly serves a very valid purpose. --'''Oppose''' Per history with the block tool.  Too many blocks that have needed to be reversed by clearer thinking admins at ANI.--In the past I have voted neutral on these reconfirmation RFAs.  However, I feel, since they seem to be proliferating, that a stronger statement is necessary.  I regard them as an insult to me as an administrator; they suggest that by not submitting myself (again) to the nonsense at RFA, I am somehow less committed. (This is the same comment I am making at HJ Mitchell's.)'''Oppose''': I also was taken aback by an administrator seemingly haphazardly throwing around topic bans on the Mexican~American War fiasco. This was utterly unproductive, unsupported by most people, and served only to distract from the issue (which is obviously a significant one as it continues to this day at ArbCom). I expect administrators to calm situations, not inflame them. –{{ec}}'''Oppose'''. I entirely agree with Dank.

But in light of the concerns being raised about taking administrative action after becoming involved, I don't understand the unwillingness to commit to the best practices outlined at [[WP:INVOLVED]]. They are best practices because we set the standard of required conduct lower, but in light of the problems in that area, seeking a commitment to the best practices does not seem unreasonable. That said, I wont put myself in the oppose column because I think the candidate has made substantial positive contributions as an admin, and I'm not convinced the WP:Involved issue rises to the level of revoking admin, but is instead an area that needs improving.'''Strongest Possible Support''' A hard-working editor who deserves a promotion. --<span style="text-shadow:#808080 0.2em 0.2em 0.2em">'''Support''' - Had a quick look through contribs and can't see any reason not to.'''Support'''.

That there was a sockpuppet in WP Aviation in the past should be of no consequence to this RFA. The early supports and the Feature list mistakenly presented as a Featured article (an honest mistake by the nominator, since corrected) were not the candidates doing, and penalizing him for it is not the way to go. Finally, regarding sourcing, the one source that generated alot of discussion is currently being examined at the reliability noticeboard and there is no consensus that it is unrealible. Even if it is found so, however, the fact that it generated so much discussion means that it is, at the very least a boderline case, and so, the candidates decision to used it is just as reasonable as would have been a decision not to use it. As for the unrealible sources added by other users, the notion presented by one of the opposers that editors are supposed to constantly watch over their GAs and should be held accountable for not undoing someone elses edit is simply silly.

It seems to me that the most important thing for an administrator—truly ''the'' single most important thing—is to, first, do no harm. I think the area where the candidate, if confirmed, could potentially be most likely to run into drama would be in closing a disputed AfD. I've looked hard at what the candidate has been saying over time, and it is very clear to me that this is someone who is, commendably, honest with himself about his strengths and weaknesses as an editor. He strikes me as someone with the good sense not to overreach. Therefore, I expect that you will be a helpful administrator. Please prove me right.

But there are some key skills that an admin needs to have demonstrated, one of which is the ability to add reliably sourced material to the pedia. If your best contributions are vandalfighting then I have to hunt for that in your contributions, and I'm afraid I don't have time to wade past all the vandalfighting to see if you have demonstrated that skill. So I suggest for next time that you include some examples of that in your best contributions. I'm not asking for a GA or even a DYK though there are some who expect that. But I do expect to be able to check that an admin has that skill. Also a minor point, would you mind changing the colour of your signature?

Ankitbatt only has about 4,000 edits over the course of 2 years, and has limited work in administrative areas. However '''quality''' is more important than ''quantity''. As the candidate has one [[WP:GA|Good Article]], and a potential for at least two more, I am hesitant to oppose on grounds of lack of experience. Content builders do gain significant policy knowledge through writing articles. Therefore I am currently neutral.

Trawled 50 random edits from a few weeks ago and found no cause for concern - apart from a couple of changes that took a little longer to be reassured about, for lack of edit summaries. I appreciate that edit summaries are an important service to other editors, but (a) I expect Armbrust would take that criticism on board, and (b) even with sparse edit summaries I think they'd still be a net positive as an admin.'''Support''' His mistakes aren't controversial and in spite of them, he meant them all in good faith and his work at FFU, Sports articles and other noticeboards/administrative areas is just superb. He is always willing to help, he helped me get my wings at FFU and he's a backlog clearing machine! Most of the time that I'm at FFU there's not 1 request where I won't see his signature.

Many apologies,'''Support''' You know..., I have not !voted in RfA or been on Wikipedia for a long time, and I am very alarmed by the fact that you can now nitpick anything you don't like about the candidate just to oppose now.

I'm not at all bothered by the timing of the run, and happy with the way you responded to the archiving issue. However Kudpung and Fetchcomms raise issues about deletion and copyvio and those are things where I prefer to see a couple of months editing before a subsequent run.

Random shuffle through past contributions does not turn up anything bad. I'm disappointed by the drama over the userbox. I extend my sympathies to those who feel offended by a userpage declaration of skepticism towards christianity, since there is very much more content on wikipedia which is offensive on the same basis, including quite a lot in article-space which is impeccably sourced. If a person felt that irreligious statements were offensive, and if that person went looking for them, this encyclopædia must surely be a challenging environment for them.'''Support''' Seems like a fine candidate. And Keepscases once again makes the bile rise in my throat with his petty, anti-atheist bigotry. When he's not asking pointless "funny" questions at RFA, he's spewing stuff like this.

As Prodego, I would have expected the condidate to have a firmer grasp of things, especially in light of the fact this is a second nomination. Many of those userboxes and the headline message on talkpage give the impression of a drama magnet, and also lends credence to the notion that neutrality may be an issue. As for the NOGOD box, if you want everyone to know you're an athiest there are much better ways of saying it than going down the confrontational route of running down others beliefs by labelling God (or all gods) as a myth or superstition &ndash; just say your an athiest, and {{t1|User atheist}} does the job just fine &ndash; shows bad judgment in my opinion. I've also been less than impressed by the candidate's somewhat dismissive response to concerns raised about it. <sub><font color="#007700">'''Oppose''' The ubx being discussed above is ''patently'' offensive because even though it mentions no particular deity, it demeans and ridicules faith. That itself is no reason to oppose, but the candidates inability to understand why others feel this way could be. The early AfD closure as well as the diffs pointed out by Prodego above are more problematic. There is too much of a [[WP:BATTLEGROUND|battleground mentality]] evidenced here, and little willingness to [[WP:STICK|put down the stick]]. None of this speaks well to the attitude needed to be an administrator at this time. I would certainly reconsider this candidate in the future with demonstration of greater maturity and more willingness to walk away when the situation calls for it.

In addition, I observe [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=457775746#User:AbsoluteGleek92_and_copyvios this], where Dayewalker's "easy question" is, in my opinion, slightly too intimidating.

My view is that any candidate for the mop should have written at least one worthwhile article. I wouldn't oppose on that ground alone, though, if there was a good track record of article expansion which there isn't here. Admins have the tools to take actions affecting content editors, deal with situations arising from content disputes, delete articles etc. In order to have a proper appreciation of the issues an admin needs to have undertaken a reasonable amount of content work. Vandal fighting; policy work etc are all essential tasks but we are here to build an encyclopaedia and that entails adding content. I am bemused by the answer to Q.7 "... I very rarely find anything that doesn't already have an article, and doesn't have what I'm looking for. When I find something missing, I'll certainly add it. As for my writing, I'm a sports and humor writer". I am sure that a trawl through [[:Wikipedia:Requested articles/Sports]] would produce plenty of relevant subjects without an article.'''Oppose'''. for many of the same reasons: no constructive contributions, too much time spent POV pushing at AN/I and a lack of civility when dealing with other users.

However, you have 4 or fewer AIV reports, so I cannot really determine how you would use the block tool. An admin will hopefully review your CSD nominations.

RFA are always loaded with a few tricky questions to extract the tiniest of screw ups or walk in a tightrope without falling, impossible for some. Very low risk of rocking the boat with the tools. --'''Support'''. Q6 is unfair IMO because it asks for a canned response on a questionable topic. Topic notability guidelines are designed to be interpretations of GNG, which asks for "significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject." A clear passing of a topic guideline, even if GNG status is in dispute, is sufficient to keep an article, because what is "significant" and "reliable" is determined solely by AfD consensus. That is, topic guidelines are designed to make the implications of GNG more objective. Now if a topic guideline clearly contradicts GNG, then it should be changed, simple as that. Regarding Q7, RfA is designed to assess how good a user will be in the adminship role. No admin would actually try to conjure up cases under which they would block someone without warning. If GiantSnowman saw clear evidence of a compromised account, I'm pretty sure he'd block it. -- [[User:King of Hearts|King of]]'''Weak support''' You look like a capable person who would use the tools well.  I'm somewhat uncomfortable with your responses to Fastily's two questions, since I don't see F9 as covering this image, and since there are [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2007-04-23/Robdurbar|occasional situations]] in which blocking is blatantly obviously necessary.  However, the image surely needs to be deleted for other reasons, so I won't see that as a reason to oppose, and as Robofish says, it's far less of a problem when an admin won't block than when an admin will block.Answer to Q6 as well as subsequent replies show a significant lack of knowledge regarding notability standards. The subject-specific guidelines contain some sort of disclaimer, such as the one in [[WP:ACADEMIC]], ''It is possible for an academic to be notable according to this standard, and yet not be an appropriate topic for coverage in Wikipedia because of a lack of reliable, independent sources on the subject'' - press releases and university biographies are not independent sources. The subject-specific guidelines mean the subject is ''most likely'' notable, but only meeting the GNG or being one of the few topics that are "inherently notable" can ''establish'' notability. To address some of the support comments, this isn't some hypothetical, contrived scenario based on an interpretation of a vague guideline, this is a question about something explicitly stated in the guideline that the candidate got wrong even after several followup replies. <span style="font-family:Broadway">'''Strong Oppose''' Changing from weak above. Watching this RFA extensively has shown me larger concerns about [[User:GiantSnowman]]. With concerns over Q6 above, I'm now also concerned about 7 and 8. As [[User:BarkingFish]] just said, if you need to block you can do so, and you NEED to do so - to protect the integrity of the project and ''possibly'' the integrity of the Account Holder. Compromised accounts do happen, and your answer to 7 shows me that you don't understand policy regarding Blocking, and your answer to question number 8 shows me you aren't that familiar with [[WP:NFCC]] and [[WP:C]]. I'm sorry, but I believe [[WP:NOTNOW|not now]] is in order here.

I think I now understand how "eager" could be considered to be a bad thing here. One of the biggest dangers in giving someone the bit is if they jump into things before they really know what they're doing and screw things up.

The summary I'd give is "trigger-happy" and its the last thing we need around here.   I would never disqualify for one or two bad taggings, but these are simply too many, and not even disputable. Those hoax taggings really concern me in particular. The first might be a result of inadequately wide reading (and not the sort of reading some people might have in mind , but mainstream novelists like PD James) , but the second must be an example of not thinking, or possibly of mistakenly tagging the wrong article--because the article when tagged had excellent sources.  I also see severe problems with communication. I should be the last one to ever use tl;dr as a reason, but the excess verbiage in Q2, and in the response below  to TCO, indicates a lack of skill in focusing on the essentials.

CSD tagging needs to be very tight. (Also, it is unclear to me if My76Strat participates in AfD.) The rather lengthy answers and discussions with other editors also worry me.

I've worked with you at AfC and seen you as a UAA regular and would love to see you be an admin in the nearish future. I'm not that concerned about specific incidents and misunderstandings, but the overall pattern of communication is problematic. Portions of your answers above are simply incomprehensible to my tiny brain, especially Q5. This is a text-based medium and clear explanations are vital, especially when working with new or misguided editors. It sounds like you have some ideas on how you'll work on this, and that's wonderful. I very much hope I can support you in a new RfA in a few month.I see overwhelming enthusiasm and nearly endless energy for the project, but I'm not convinced that you're ready for the extra tools just yet. I echo many of the people who gave comments in this RfA, mainly keeping cool and calm under pressure (and therefore offering optimal responses to queries and such). I commend your willingness to see this through to the end; don't let the criticism bring you down or dampen your enthusiasm even as you take it on board to improve. Best,'''Oppose''' based largely on communication issues. My76Strat's commentary is commonly impenetrable, needlessly and often incorrectly using phraseology that prevents clear understanding. A great deal of administrative work ''requires'' accessible communication with editors of highly variable English-speaking abilities.

In the example I cited, the user made 81 edits over four days, edits that were so bad another person reverted darned near all of them. But what the hell, his Edit Count is nearly 100 ticks higher! Woo hoo! In the copy-editing, vandal-fighting, spell-checking dungeon where I spend a good deal of my time, this is not at all uncommon; if you incent a behavior, you'll see more of it. Even. worse. are. the. editors. that. save. every. stinkin'. word. as. a. separate. edit. Sure, it rapidly increments their Edit Count, but it makes cleaning up after them horribly tedious and far more difficult than it need be. Having spent an entire morning—three or four hours—working on '''ONE''' big edit, I know I will never log 25,000 '''quality''' edits. Personally, I don't think we—an organization trying to encourage volunteers to donate their time—have any business belittling their efforts. And, as [[User:Ironholds|Ironholds]] ([[User talk:Ironholds#top|talk]]) stated in another RfA, far more eloquently than can I: <blockquote>''Are you a content writer? I am, and I can tell you that if you think just producing the raw content is the most important thing in the world, you're mistaken. There are writers, there are copyeditors, and there are janitors. All have a role to play, and when we're discussing someone's aptitude for janitorial tools, an absence of writing should not be an issue. Wikipedia's tagline is "the encyclopedia that anyone can edit", and since "anyone" includes "dicks", someone who thinks that countering those dicks is not a prime goal is simply wrong, as is somebody who mistakes "our main goal" for "our only goal, to the exclusion of all other contributions". Have you got any evidence, whatsoever, that JaGa is incompetent in the janitorial field? He's applying for janitorial tools, he's asking for the trust of the community in using them. If you cannot find evidence to indicate that he'd be a bad person to hold them, all other concerns are irrelevant.''</blockquote> Bravo! We need more of this thinking! Me, personally? I wouldn't stand a snowball's chance here because, as soon as someone implied my 500 or so rarely-reverted edits over three or so years (and the hundreds of no-charge hours they represent) don't measure up to some arbitrary and capricious '''number''', I'd likely tell them—loudly—to take a long walk on a really short pier on a really cold day. As for NickPenguin, though, I say "give him the mop!" The arguments opposed to his application seem specious, at best. &mdash;&nbsp;'''Support'''  Has potential.  Some people know about the RfC that I recently madde of him, but the username should not count for potential for being an sysop.  ~~'''Support''': The contributions I see look solid and I'm more concerned with the tone many of the NOTENOUGHCONTRIBS opposes take than I am about the relatively relaxed workrate.'''Support''' the user seems clueful and that they can be trusted with the tools.  Best,'''[[User:Coffee/RFA-standards|Oppose]]''' - I was going to await the candidate's answer to my question before I made up my mind, but Nick's latest comments show that he indeed does not have enough experience to become an admin. A5 was worrying by itself, but then he stated almost outrightly that he has basically zero knowledge currently on how to look at an article and determine if it should be speedy deleted vs. nominated for AFD, (after clearly stating in A1 that it would be an area that he will focus in as an admin). I also don't see the sudden need for Nick to have the tools only after becoming slightly active again over the past two months, and he's apparently only "observed" critical admin areas (places stated in A1) before then. Having admin rights shouldn't be something you learn "[[OJT|on the job]]", but should instead be granted to those who not only show a clear need for them, but also a clear understanding on what they should do with them when they have them. Therefore I do not think the candidate should receive the tools at this time. <small style="color:#999;white-space:nowrap;text-shadow:lightgrey 0.3em 0.3em 0.15em;">&mdash;'''Neutral''' I echo Airplaneman's !vote, get some more administrative experience and come back in 5-6 months. —<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;font-variant:small-caps;">'''[[User:Ancapp|<font color=red>Ancient Apparition</font>]] •'''Oppose''' We do like to see more admin-hopefuls go into the reverting vandalism department.

What's extremely concerning is how you [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Reenem&action=historysubmit&diff=410302494&oldid=407600820 removed] all evidence of negative interaction from your talk page moments before transcluding this RfA. This tells me that you're trying to hide what you think are your low moments instead of addressing them straight-on in this RfA. An administrator will have to deal with situations much worse than what was removed, and being unable and/or unwilling to address issues is highly concerning. I also echo the comments from the above opposers. And a small typo you made in your self-nom: it seems you were blocked thrice, not twice. Until I'm convinced otherwise by your answers to the additional questions or general composure throughout this RfA, I'm stuck here. Please don't take the opposes personally; I am not here to put you down, and it would be depressing to see you stop editing because of this (something I've seen happen more than once. However, these comments provide points for you to improve and answer your question on whether or not the community thinks you're ready to assist with admin operations on this encyclopedia.

Best,'''Oppose''' per Iridescent. A7 does not apply if there is "any credible claim of significance or importance", irrespective of Google searches, reliable sources or verifiability. Deleting something under A7 because your "news/scholar search gives undesirable results." shows a very serious misunderstanding of the speedy deletion criteria, which is a problem since this is the area you state you plan to spend most of your admin time in, if given the mop.'''Oppose''' I would need a better understanding of the speedy deletion process to support, since that is the area Rehman is planning to work in. Come back after making more substantive contributions to AFD and reviewing how speedy deletion works. In particular, admins usually don't delete articles they themselves have tagged for speedy deletion.--'''Support'''.

His open and direct answer explaining his privacy concerns satisfies me. Nobody claims that this or any editor be infallible, and so I believe that a handful of minor editing mistakes should not deprive the community of a proven administrator. I would urge other early "opposers" to reconsider the decision. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">'''Oppose''' Per above. Concerns with policy knowledge.  Furthermore, after reading your nomination statement and question answers, you do not present yourself as someone with a legitimate need for the tools.

I am also concerned that Richardcavell has personal issues with privacy. Becoming an admin isn't going to make that easier, although it is unclear to me if the privacy issues had any relation to Wikipedia. (I don't really want to know.)'''Weak support''' I am a bit reluctant here and agree with Courcelles. I highly recommend the candidate get some experience in content.'''Support''' Clearly a trustworthy, decent chap. Concerns about lack of experinece with whatever are irrelevant.

From recent interactions, I know that this is a quality candidate.

Also, in re: Question six - Well done.'''Support''' That small thud offstage was the sound of Snotty falling off his chair. I have a long and acrimonious history with this editor, and some heated rebuttal of his past deletionist stance. However he seems to have shifted his position: he'd still delete things I'd probably keep, but he's doing it from a balanced position now, not just as a reflex. I might not agree with his judgements any more as an admin that I would as an editor, but I trust him not to abuse mop powers and to recognise that on subjective content judgements, admins remain as just another voice amongst editors. I wouldn't support any admin with ''that userbox'', but that's a past issue now and I don't think we're talking about the same person. His technical skills also appear to be at a rather higher level than most editors can offer, and I'm sure that would be of benefit to the project. I'd like to see him tone down the opposition to ARS though - that sort of confrontation is never productive long term.'''Support''' per excellent answer to questions 6 and (more seriously) 10. Also, answer to Q3 indicates that SW is unlikely to be closing many AfD discussions involving the ARS. SW seems clear on the difference between voicing an opinion in an AFD !vote and trying to rise above personal opinion when performing an AfD closure. A safe pair of hands, IMHO.'''Support''' - SW is an asset to the project and understands the big picture. Wikipedia needs users that are decicated and SW is certainly dedicated. However, I would encourage SW to work on areas that others have mentioned. Personnaly, I think SW would be highly valuable at teaching new users how to create proper articles, but I will leave that up to him if he wants to participate in that area. - ''''''''Support''' Completely suitable candidate for adminship. Well versed in policy. "Tells it like it is." Just by reading through the opposes, it's obvious the vast majority emanate from content disputes with Snottywong, not from any "fear" of him abusing power.'''Oppose'''. It looks like you've allowed a strong personal bias to manifest itself on Wikipedia. That's concerning to me. WikiPhilosophies are just like real life philosophies: I wouldn't trust a self-proclaimed [[Young Earth creationist]] who clashing with others over at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Evolutionary biology|Wikiproject Evolutionary biology]] to impartially assess the neutrality of [[evolution]]. In that same sense, I couldn't trust a self-proclaimed deletionist who clashes with others at the [[WP:ARS|article rescue squadron]] to impartially assess deletion discussions. An admin has to demonstrate a neutral demeanor to those with different opinions. You've demonstrated the opposite. '''''Oppose''' this candidate has temperament issues which concern me. He seems unduly combative in discussions and I do not feel he confident that he would not use the tools inappropriately.'''Oppose''' My first inclination was to remain neutral. However, having reviewed some of his postings at AfD, I don't think that this user has reached the level of maturity required of an administrator. Perhaps sometime in the future but certainly not now.--'''Neutral''' - I was actually contemplating a weak support as per Jclemens, but cullen's experience really put a dampener on that.'''Oppose''' due to serious concerns regarding {{u|Spongefrog}}'s maturity. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml">  ''''''Weak Support''' I think this is a bit of a surprise for me going in the Support column, as the opposes have raised a couple of concerns, including deletion tagging errors as mentioned by WSC, but I think he does has the necessities of an administrator.

I notice that Coffee and PeterSymonds are both admins who regained tools after they were removed following this incident. Opposers using this as an excuse to oppose prove the classic idea at RFA that you can never be forgiven for anything on Wikipedia. Anyway, no reason why this candidate won't make a good admin.The lack of trust shown in the opposition has proven to me that there are people, who after 3 years, cannot seem to forgive an error, and who cannot look past the one bad judgement error to see the 3 solid years of contributions to this wiki. This is disgusting. Steven Zhang is a well-rounded, dedicated, extremely clueful user who made a slip up 3 years ago. It's amazing that people can't see the opportunity presented to us. We need admins.

Steven's last major issue was back in 2008, and while it was a very concerning issue, it's been three years and he's had time to mature, and mature he has.

The above comments convince me that he'd likely be an OK admin, and we need admins. The Oppose comments raise some good objections, but looking at the totality I'm willing to take the chance that he'll be alright. Regarding the 2008 incident in particular, meh. He didn't ''hack'' the Wikipedia and then go on some destructive rampage or something. Somebody left their password open to being figured out, an attractive nuisance if you will, and so forth. Willing to overlook that.'''Oppose''', too many questions and concerns about this user to ignore.'''Oppose''' Too many issues, too many questions, too many explanations, too many unknowns, I don't see the point, sorry...'''Oppose.''' Surely a valuable contributor to the Project, and better than many current admins who got in when it was easy.

While I had no impression of lack of maturity before, I do after reading them. You've completely shattered my confidence. Your nomination and answer to Q1 were great. Then Q2: "I have not accumulated a large amount of high-quality content..." Ahh! That's something you ''don't'' say in an RfA, explanation or not! Then Q3: "I have been party in a minor dispute (mainly because of my immaturity..." {{facepalm}}. That would ''also'' be something you avoid saying in your RfA. I appreciate you owning up to your mistakes, but some things are better left forgotten when trying to instill community confidence in yourself. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but you should know how important those questions are. It's nothing but first impressions for a lot of people, and those answers make for a terrible first impression. '''''Very strong oppose''' I was rather inclined to say "oppose" on the basis of lack of evidence of experience related to administrative issues, but before committing myself I searched for participation in deletion discussions, as that is an area in which the candidate has indicated an intention of acting. I found some. At best the candidate's contributions were trivial (e.g. "delete per nom") and at worst they showed '''''really serious''''' ignorance of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. For example, both [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Development_of_Windows_8&diff=prev&oldid=415163457 here] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Second_Revolution_flag_%282nd_nomination%29&diff=prev&oldid=415164154 here] the candidate says "Speedy Delete and Merge". For someone with such profound lack of knowledge of policy as that to be an administrator closing deletion discussions would be completely unacceptable. (I might also suggest that saying "the administrator's noticeboard, which in my opinion all good and respectable admins should frequent" is not a good way of gaining support. Do you really think that those administrators who do not choose to work in that particular area are bad and unrespectable? This is a very minor matter compared to the major concern I have mentioned, but it doesn't help your case.)'''Oppose''' as above. I'm afraid you just don't appear to have enough experience in the areas you've worked, let alone the areas you haven't.

Before I could support this candidate, I'd need to see contributions to discussions at least on AfD nominations, in order to evaluate both their judgment and their ability to apply policies. --'''Moral support''' - It looks like you do good work around the wiki, and I hope you continue to do good work.  Like some other users, I appreciate the honesty in your self-nom statement, but the tone of the statement is quite aggressive and defiant, and only serves to give you a snowball's chance in hell of succeeding here.

Looking at your recent history I see several things that concern me over your knowledge of policy. The speedy tagging identified by [[User:WereSpielChequers|WereSpielChequers]] above and at [[Serwan Baban]] concern me over you knowledge of the speedy criteria, which is an area you say you want to work in. The [[Route M4 (Manhattan)]] article where you restored the prod tag to the article twice after it was removed, was only a couple of weeks ago and how this was wrong had to be pointed out to you on your talk page. The AFD comment brought up by [[User:SarekOfVulcan|SarekOfVulcan]] is also concerning. Given that speedy deletion and AFD closing are areas where you want to work in as an admin these recent examples, combined with not having much content experience, lead me to have to oppose at this time. I see evidence you are learning from you mistakes however and hope (if this fails) I can support you in the future where you have more experience showing knowledge of policy in the areas you want to work in.'''Oppose''' Content is a consideration, but your deletion record is the big issue. Following on from where Malleus left off, if an admin is doing his or her job properly, vested interests are irrelevant at AfD (unless it is a breach of [[WP:COI]]). All that matters is qualitative discussion based on policy or guidelines. That fact that you see a vested interest as an issue suggests to me that you would close AfDs democratically, which is entirely wrong. As a non-admin, I'd be grateful if an uninvolved admin or crat could verify DaveWild's claim that a PROD was incorrectly re-added twice on [[Route M4 (Manhattan)]]. I'm in no doubt that it's true, but it would be helpful to get confirmation from an uninvolved party. --'''Oppose''' I hate to oppose, but I do like to see some content creation.

So he's got my support again.

A positive contributor who would be helpful with admin tools in his areas of interest. If he is aware of his limitations, then all the better. As for the MisterWiki business: Obviously unblocking a previously disruptive user entails some risk and not everyone will agree whether the risk is justified. But I think volunteering to help mitigate the risk with mentoring is a positive thing for a prospective admin, not a reason to oppose. --'''Strong Oppose <s>Oppose</s>''' My latest interaction involved the same incident as Ryan.  I'm sure it was an honest mistake.  However it demonstrated an inability to actually look at a situation before you started punching buttons.  I'm very concerned you'd carry on this same method of button first, figure out what's going on after people tell you about it.--'''Oppose''' My only experience in looking at the candidate's edits in detail was the recent MisterWiki/DiegoGrez unblock.. situation, and within that I saw character traits which admins should not possess. MW was blocked in mid-January, the candidate waited only till late February to initiate an unblock discussion. When that didn't happen, the early April re-run caused by MW/DG's rename request became a platform for the candidate to start banging the same drum, posting repeatedly and drawing up a heavy set of restrictions as conditions of MW's unblock. The restrictions were only necessary because it was far too soon to unblock such a time-wasting individual. One of these restrictions was agreed to be watered down at MW/DG's request [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADiego_Grez&action=historysubmit&diff=355172432&oldid=355168911 just under an hour] after they were posted to MW/DG's talkpage. In the same ANI thread the candidate highlights in bold that anyone commenting should be trusting him, not the user whose unblock was in question (guilt trips, they '''really''' impress me), and at least once bandies around the [[WP:AGF]] bomb without qualification, something as helpful in conversations as throwing around [[WP:DICK]]. During all this, it didn't occur that perhaps he was about as far South of being a neutral party as possible, in terms of being a mentor, and that someone else might be more even-handed. As well as seemingly being unable to recognize the limits of his own neutrality the candidate appears to treat 'friends' differently to 'enemies', there's something very plastic about the responses left for those who disagreed with the unblock. Doesn't bode well for someone who will be expected to wade into all sorts of awkward slap-fights. There are suggestions that DG's progress justifies his unblock, but not kicking water out of the paddling pool he's been confined to for a few weeks is not proof of anything. Considering that the candidate supposedly stuck their neck out in the above situation the fact that this RFA is happening before any real conclusions can be drawn is extremely dubious.'''Oppose''' For the reasons explained well above, but specifically the MisterWiki situation. Having looked at that in detail, I see a somewhat puzzling insistence on unblocking this disruptive user, and insufficient agreement from others that it was a good idea. Even some of the few admins who expressed a wish that the mentorship would be a success tended to temper that opinion with statements like they would not, themselves, have been willing to unblock on this occasion. The candidate stated that his reputation was on the line with this trip "out on a limb" - yet the jury is surely still out. I also have concerns about a potential Admin who states he is "hazy" on policy and cannot trust himself with some of the tools. ''(disclaimer: yes, I know I have very few edits, and have never voted at RFA before - I fully expect my opinion might be given less weight than some - but I am a user with an account, and the guideline says anyone with an account may vote - so, given that I hold the opinion, there it is)'''''Support''' per my boredom at vetting this editor (no drama I can find, nothing interesting, entirely collegiate collaboration, content work, and gnoming) and the answer to Q11.'''Support''' I swear some of these RfA questions are designed to trip you up, but the answers here are really good.'''Support''' - to be honest, I thought J04N already was an admin.

Some are a bit on the edge, I acknowledge—but perhaps it shows that the candidate was not aware those taggings would be controversial (which itself would concern me), since they were made either during this RfA week or in the lead-up to it when admin candidates are typically being additionally careful.

Most of the "oppose" votes seem to be due to the shaky understanding of speedy-deletion criteria that he reveals in his response to Q7; I submit that this is not a relevant concern -- because he little history of working on speedy deletion (this lack of experience could help explain his shaky understanding) and he does not indicate an interest in working in that arena. I do wish he'd provide more edit summaries, but I suppose summaries aren't real important when most of your edits are in AfD discussions... --'''Strong support'''. Excellent user, great contributions in admin-related areas. Mandsford and I disagree, and have done repeatedly, but the one constant is that he can always justify his argument. The only occasion of incivility I've run into with him was me acting like a dick and him persuading me to calm down. Some of the opposers are exactly who I expected; the hemp-and-sandal wearing, pot-smoking hippie brigade identifiable by the smell of patchouli drifting after them and the way they keep chaining themselves to forlorn Amazonian articles at risk of being chopped down. They'd be more persuasive if they weren't going "OMG HE CHANGES HIS MIND, HOW AWFUL IS THAT!". You're right, keeping an open mind is a horrible, horrible thing to do.'''Support'''  I waffled on this, my first reading of your answer to Q7 left me almost voting oppose, but on rereading it, I believe that I read the question differently than I did.  I read it as asking "as an admin you find this article already tagged A7, what do you do?" and it appears that you read it as "was the tagging defensible (even if not correct) in the first place?", which are enormously different questions. While you and I will probably disagree on a few subjective calls (based on at least one of your other answers), your answers were within policy and reason. I would ask that you consider the advice given elsewhere to think a little bit in AfD debates early on, but that is advice that I need to take myself as well, and I suspect you will be a NETPOS. --<font color='#66dd44'>'''Support''' - net positive.

This is a bit problematic, in that he's obviously working in a new area, in good faith, but failing to listen to the counsel of other admins (like, oh, me) who've worked in the area and understand precedent and consensus as applied to this particular facet of Wikipedia. This, in concert with his lack of content creation, suggests that he may in good faith end up doing a lot of damage as he expands his scope, contrary to the answer to question 1.  This is precisely the reason that administrators should have adequate content creation experience.  If VernoWhitney is confirmed, he needs to learn to rely on the advice of contributors with more experience in an area when he enters it, and if he is not promoted in this RfA, he should seek to expand his scope of interactions, such that he can use the tools effectively in any realm.  Given his polite and straightforward manner, I would be willing to support him in a future RfA once he has demonstrated content competence. Non-copyright problems are handled in a vastly different manner than copyright problems, and I do not currently have confidence in the candidate's ability to effectively manage the former, despite his compelling track record in the latter.My head says support, my gut says go neutral. Without question, we need to improve admin recruitment in this area, arguably more than any other. The answer to Q6 and good comments on your temperment suggest that you are well equipped to deal with those who were unwittingly committing copyvio. But S Marshall makes valid points, and the first in particular is one that I'd been mulling over before seeing it.

In my experience,  the amount of work needed to make a "real article" should not be a deterrent.  IMHO, some significant experience in XfD discussions is valuable.

Also, strongly support answer given to '''Q.8''' above.I happen to think the article in question 6 does closely paraphrase the source. It's not obvious copy-pasting, but a number of consecutive sentences are largely the same. I picked that example because the candidate placed that nomination in the prep area. No big deal for me though, it's very difficult to pin down a clear view on close paraphrasing and it's not a very clear case (watch now: a number of editors will probably come along and disagree it's close paraphrasing). But DYK and other main page areas are places that need a lot more scrutiny at the moment from experienced admins who will keep a better eye out for close paraphrasing, dodgy sources and BLP violations: see the mini-essay on my user page. I don't think you have the experience at the moment to fulfil this role, I'm sorry. Also, per HJMitchell, a bit more experience in other areas would be useful given the breadth of the admin toolset. --'''Oppose''' - You seem like a productive Wikipedian, but I'm not confident that you have enough experience.

Per above.  Concerns with experience, judgement, policy knowledge, and maturity.  Sorry, ''''''Oppoes''', good points raised by other opposers, but I was particularly put off by [[User_talk:Access_Denied/Archive_3#Hm...|this conversation]]. Firstly, everyone is entitled to their opinion regarding content work at RFA. However, you seem to be completely unaware of what makes some RFA voters value content work, dismissing it as a "silly idea that everyone needs to spend all their time on FA writing". That makes me think that you haven't read those kinds of opposes properly, or haven't really thought about where they come from. Secondly, it seems that you said that you avoid article writing for fear of being blocked for tendentious editing or edit warring. That's worrying. Thirdly, you talk about "the way-too-frequent situation of having a blatant G10 sit there all night". There is no reason for a blatant G10 to sit there all night if one editor has seen it. If you see a G10, you should blank it while waiting for it to be deleted. Great work on vandal-fighting, although I'd like to see you slow down a little to reduce some of the mistakes mentioned. I suggest getting some more experience around the project and either getting involved in content writing, or finding some other way to show that you are right for the tools.--'''Oppose''' Per SandyGeorgia's very convincing arguments. I would also like to see this editor not only get a little more diverse experience but also be on the project for a little longer before being handed a mop. Having said that, please keep up the work vandal-fighting, just with a little more care.'''Neutral''' Experienced in fighting vandalism, but not much else.  Even though I commented on another recent RfA that there's no requirement for candidates to be familiar with, or experienced in, all aspects of Wikipedia, you really need to expand your resume into other areas that may require Admin tools, such as [[WP:NPP|new page patrolling]] or [[WP:3O|third-opinion requests]].  At least minimal work in actual article creation would be very useful...it doesn't have to be [[WP:FA|a featured article]], or even [[WP:GA|qualify for "good" status]], but there needs to be some level of actual content creation.  (Yeah, I know, I'm a fine one to talk!)  As for the use of Huggle, I've also commented [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Tide_rolls&diff=362002928&oldid=362002198 elsewhere] on that, and don't count your use of that tool against you in any way.

I like Alan16 as a candidate for adminship because (a) he has a year's experience but no history of "drama"; (b) his article work seems to be his primary focus, and he would be an admin "when needed"; and (c) he seems intelligent, trustworthy, and articulate. His efforts at WikiProject Novels are laudable. It's particularly good to see a potential admin who wants to help out with the always-backlogged [[WP:RM]]. However, there are some issues which make me hesitate to support. The dearth of edits in the last three months (and, really, since the last RfA) is hard to ignore, and I would like to see more experience in the project namespace. In any case, I'd like to see the rest of the answers to the questions before supporting.'''This is long overdue.''' Excellent anti-vandal work and '''''over 800 DYK's?'''''

Identifying problems is a big skill, and Alansohn has gone to the heart of the vandalism matter with a simple solution - require regristration.  I have to agree.  I speak as a fellow Huggler who has "only" 50,000 edits: give this editor the buttons.  My very best wishes to Alanshon - a mighty Wikipedian!'''Moral support''' Given the problems of the past, I'd rather see another 6-12 months go by.  But I'm not seeing recent issues and you are clearly a great contributor and care quite deeply about the place.  I disagree with some of your answers, but they aren't so unreasonable as to be wrong, merely different than mine (the IP answer especially).Many people seem to be wowed by the large number of edits and the massive number of DYKs. I don't see much collaboration activity: very few article talk page and project talk page edits compared to the rest. The long block history is worrying as well; yes, the last was over a year ago, but ''that many'' blocks at all spanning more than two years deserves a good explanation. The temperament concerns raised by others also deserve an explanation. <span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:80%;">'''/'''Strongly oppose'''.  Alan believes that XFDs and DRVs should be closed by counting heads, and that any admin who discounts votes based upon strength of argument is the equivalent of a "supervote". [[Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2010_July_4]]  In addition, there is the matter of his attitude.  His many blocks while under an editing restriction by the arbcom for incivility [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Footnoted_quotes#Alansohn_restricted]] worry me as well.  I appreciate that he says he has toned it down at XFD during the last few months, but July isn't that long ago, and besides, it's going to take far longer than a few months for me to trust him as an admin.  --'''Strong oppose''' block log, longstanding behaviour problems and a shocking lack of understanding of deletion issues, which is absolutely essential in an admin.

The candidate's response to Q7 is completely unlike what I had seen from him previously, and even the DRV exchange from July seems more like a heated debate than the sort of personal attack I'd seen from Alansohn previously. (I seem to have utterly screwed up the numbering sequence in Oppose, sorry. I've tried three times to repair it. Sorry)'''Neutral''' because there is little to  be gained by  adding  to  the pile-on  'opposes' , and BrownHairedGirl's comment  above summarises the situation  well. Nevertheless, the comments  of those  who  have cited lack  of collaboration/communication, and blocks,  appear to  be well  founded. Even if the civility  issues are borderline, they  are frequent enough  to  suggest  that  the pattern of communication  may  only  tone down after a period of concentrated effort. The high  edit  count is not a qualification - a gnome who  has made 15,000 'contributory' edits to  article space that  take 20  minutes each, or who  even prepares longer edits /articles in  their user space or offline, has done as much  or even more for the encyclopedia as a vandal fighter  using  a software solution  to  make 150,000 edits at  the rate of 20  a minute. As long  as it's not  just  a 'beat the bot' exercise, the candidate is already  providing  a vital contribution without  the tools, and when he has had the patience to  diversify, and make edits and decisions that  take more time, and that will demonstrate a clearer understanding  of some of the core policies, that  will be the time when the next  RfA will  succeed.--Judging from the user talk page and the absurd introduction in this RFA, I don't think Alex is ready.--Application indicates a lack of familiarity with Adminiship on Wikipedia.'''Oppose''' per lack of judgement in opening statement and for repeated use of 'my man' (it's outdated and sexist, IMHO).'''Oppose''' There's simply not enough experience that the user can discern community consensus.

None of those are fatal, but given the broader context of these edits, I cannot support.'''Moral support'''. It's great to see an active editor from India whose aim is "improvement of grammar, cohesion, formatting, layout and general presentation and look of an article" - there are lots of India-related articles that need a lot of improvement, and we're under-represented by [[WP:GNOME|Gnomes]] and [[WP:COPYEDIT|copy-editors]] from that part of the world.

PS: Andrensath the answer to Q4 is lots of sandbox edits polishing drafts. -'''Support''' candidate is a longterm editor with a clean block log. Judging from their [http://toolserver.org/~soxred93/pages/index.php?name=Cgoodwin+&lang=en&wiki=wikipedia&namespace=0&redirects=noredirects 78 created articles], and looking through their deleted contributions, the candidate was ready for the Autopatroller flag, and I've just actioned that. As for knowing whether articles should or should not be deleted we can only judge them from their proven ability to create articles that don't get deleted. Many of us are used to judging candidates by their record of identifying what should be deleted, but that is to an extent the other side of the same coin. Looking through the candidate's contributions I did see the occasional reversion of vandalism, though without the follow through of warning the vandal. I noticed the concern about their large number of user space edits - but looking at those edits they are clearly article building in their sandbox before copying articles into mainspace. If this RFA fails, and I hope it doesn't, I  would suggest that in future when a draft is ready, moving if from sandbox into mainspace rather than copy pasting its contents into mainspace would prevent future misunderstandings of that nature. ''So they haven't been active in admin areas yet. Usually, I'd be concerned, but they're clearly trustworthy and I have no problem with them receiving the tools. ''''''Support''' Absolutely no concerns. Cgoodwin builds the encyclopedia, and that is a good thing. Many people are given the mop because they prove they are good at tagging things that should be deleted by hanging around the right message board, but this creates a systemic bias wherein we promote people who want the mop for the sake of having the mop. This is an editor who doesn't show a great deal of motivation to have the mop, but who just enjoys working on Wikipedia. There is no harm in granting the tools to someone like this, because there isn't a quota for admin actions because you want to have the tools in the hands of trusted and committed editors to allow them to take admin action when they see it, rather than waste time calling one of us. Personally, I've barely used my mop recently, taking the opportunity to simply enjoy reading articles for the past few months, but I'm ready to take action if the need presents itself.'''Support''' I'm leaning to Neutral but I have no reason not to trust you with the mop. <b>[[User:FD|<font color="Red" face="Tahoma">Fridae'§Doom</font>]] &#124;'''Strong Support''':  I can't believe the comments in opposition!  Not enough involvement?  Au Contraire!  Here we have a contributor who does good work, knows good work from poor work, and most of all, is a master at staying OUT of the drama wars!  For crying out loud!  If  Cg HAD gotten into every drama on wikipedia that crossed the bow (like I, unfortunately, have tended to do) then the opposition would be running along the lines of "getting TOO involved,"  "overinvolvement in the dramas," etc.  This is a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation.  Sheesh!  We have a PERFECT candidate here, no real enemies other than one known nutcase, proven level-headedness, ability to not get hooked by the nonsense.  Cg is quiet, but very responsible, I have worked with this editor since Cg first appeared on wikipedia and if nothing else, Cg has survived the gauntlet of my trout-slappable approach to quality control over at WikiProject Equine!  I mean, just putting up with ME alone should quality someone for adminship!  This is a true grownup in a world where true grownups are needed. ;-)'''Oppose''' - Overall the candidate seems to be a positive for the project, but I don't see enough experience outside of article writing to warrant adminship (only 41 edits in the Wikipedia: namespace for example). I would recommend gaining experience in areas such as RfA, AfD, AIV, etc and come back in 6-8 months.'''Oppose''' - Excellent work on articles and I disagree with people working off of percentage (for example, I have about 75% article work, but a few hundred edits to wikipedia space, but this would be judged badly). However, that flies out of the window when the user only has 41 edits to wiki space. Moral support, but more experience is needed.'''Oppose''' clearly an asset to the project, I feel bad opposing, but Wikipedia adminship is a queer beast that takes much familiarity to understand. I do believe that extensive contribution to, and collaboration in the article space is indicative the the best qualities that an admin can have but experience is still a requisite. Just as in the way that academics who have years of experience writing can come to Wikipedia and get keel hauled by a system they don't understand so to can users who have long had experience in the article space flounder when they try to get involved in the maintenance processes, the rules of which are not at all obvious. This is evidenced in the record, looking at Cgoodwin's most recent contribution to an AfD: "Please do not delete. There are other worse, poor, non notable and even hoax articles and comments that are still in existence on WP.", I would have pegged him as a newbie. To the candidate: You are wonderful, sir! But I can't support you for adminship until you have taken the time to observe and experiment with the the way the system works, which I hope you do. We always need more admins!'''Oppose''' Like Reyk, moved from neutral based on the trite answers to serious questions.  Please, take a few months, watch how a few RfA's go, and consider coming back when you're ready to address the community's concerns in a bit more verbose manner.  No hard feelings, but just "no" at this point.'''Oppose.''' You're clearly great at editing the mainspace, and you're a benefit to Wikipedia. However, the answers to some of the questions you give are very short, and that worries me. "No, I would tag it" for example is very short and does not explain much at all. Also, even though you may wish to focus on a different area, I like ''all'' admins to have significant contributions to Wikipedia: pages, and unfortunately you don't have enough for me. --'''Oppose''' per [[WP:NOTNOW]].

An example of a mistake in this area, I think, is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:68.236.155.129&diff=380867179 here] - the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akahi_Nui?diff=380867169 edit in question] was not vandalism.

Your last RFA was a mere two months ago. On your first RFA, Xeno suggested that you wait at least 6-9 months before running again. You also just ran an editor review and although your only response was positive, you should've waited more time to see what others said. I have seen you around and I do think you will make a great administrator, someday. That being said, you will draw a lot of opposes because you have had a RFA a mere two months ago and in that time there is no way that any editor, even the best ones, could gain so much knowledge and become an effective administrator. I would advise that you wait at least a year before running again and seek a coach in this time. I am saying this because you are in the place where I was two years ago. Look at my RFA history and you will see that you are mirroring me in more than a few ways.

If you say yes, then you're not supporting your fellow admin and if you say no or "let's discuss it", then it's a double standard.  Your answer of "I'm not going to be the one to make the block" is probably what most admins feel, if we're honest.  But your answer to #10 really bothers me.  That second one obviously cannot be allowed to stay like that.  It needs to immediately be deleted or sourced - not hang around waiting for a prod.  BLP is a fundamental policy and a firm understanding of it is the most important job for an admin. --'''Oppose'''.

Fifteen months is a long time, but it takes more than waiting patiently to be an admin. If I were you, I would think long and hard about whether I wanted to be an admin. If the answer is still yes, then I would spend another 3 months at least gaining more experience in the areas I wanted to work in (interesting that someone who wants to work at AIV hasn't been granted rollback, but that's not an indicator of anything in and of itself).'''Oppose''' - While I agree with Ironholds, and don't oppose on the points he's addressing, the Q5 and Q6 answers are problematic.'''Oppose''' - Trick question or not, Q6 throws me.

Assuming this Rfa fails, could I suggest, Jerem43, that you try an Rfa again much sooner in time than the last one, perhaps next spring?

Only 168 edits to the wikipedia namespace is fairly low. People above have mentioned that it is good that you have AfD experience. If you had good general AfD experience I would count this as a plus but you only really have experience in karate related AfDs. As an admin you would be expected to operate in areas other than karate. In fact using your admin tools to fight vandals and handle deletions within the area you edit is generally frowned upon.

I believe this will put others at ease (at least myself) as you can demonstrate Policy knowledge (building this also there) and that your not afraid to answer queries as well and deal with moments of stress for other editors. Addtionally your edits are consitant for a long period of time. But you range from about 10 to 100 edits a month, while you (others) argue quantity vs quality, I still think you need to double or even triple your involvment in the project. This can easily be done by branching out from Karate related articles (you could still contribute there) but you could also contribute in other areas as well. Same stories just different topics. Finally I would suggest for constructive feedback as well you consider [[Wikipedia: Editor Review]] after your RFA or down the road. You'll get alot of benefit from that I think.

While I agree entirely with the position Ling.Nut takes with respect to trivia at the "quid pro quo" talk page, administrators should set an example in how to get their point across (i.e., not by swearing at those who disagree with them). I should be able to support Ling.Nut's candidacy after an extended time of active editing in which no such problems manifest themselves, i.e., after it becomes clear that Ling.Nut has succeeded in retiring that "dark" personality.

That is further reinforced when the user in question does not seem to currently be doing anything admin related, and when they actually rule out several admin areas (vandal fighting, XfD, blocking) without ruling any in. Secondly, this user is frequently contemptuous and dismissive of those he disagrees with, which is completely unacceptable for an admin. Thirdly, the user is clearly out of sympathy with Wikipedia policies and guidelines in several respects (e.g. "I find the idea of preventing people from editing the encyclopedia anyone can edit a bit distasteful"). That would be fine if I detected a suggestion of "I don't agree with policy X, but I will do my best to uphold it per consensus", but I don't. Instead I see remarks such as "CONSENSUS is wholly and completely a farce on Wikipedia ... Feel free to do the right thing at any time" (i.e. to do ''what you personally think'' is "the right thing", irrespective of consensus). The whole manner and tone of many of the editors comments here and elsewhere suggest that this quote '''''is absolutely representative of the editor's approach''''', and so I fear a use of admin tools to carry out his own wishes, not to serve the community's consensus. There are other reasons for not being happy with this candidate, covered above by other commentators, but those three are the ones that I find most compelling.'''Oppose''' Well intentioned self nom, but nowhere near ready per q's.

As you will likely work with deletion, practice tells that you'll receive daily emails asking why a page was deleted, what should be done to avoid that, and even how could you assist that. Those emails should ''not'' originate from your clients. I do believe you have honestly disclosed your COI and I respect that, but. It is still not compatible with the admin privileges.'''Neutral'''. While the candidate does seem to know and understand policy in most areas, I would like to see better content contribution, more edits, and a much more consistent editing pattern.Not seeing enough activity to judge the knowledge of a wide range of policies that an admin should have. Great vandalism work, but you're not just requesting a block button. I would like to see that someone has enough knowledge and experience to be trusted with access to all the tools, not just the block privilege.'''Neutral''' I looked back at your last 3,000 edits (including the deleted ones), which is going back to 18th December last years. I found that only 104 edits were *not* automated. Only 25 of these were edits to articles (and they were all minor edits, even if not labelled as such). 54 of them were to talk pages (others' or your own), 9 of those were to User pages (others' or your own), 5 were to article talk, and the remaining 11 were to the "Wikipedia:" namespace. Much as I admire the anti-vandalism work, I see hardly any evidence of "admin-type" activity in the last 4 months (all the reports to AIV, for example, were automated). There are a couple of AfDs back in December, but nothing since, for example. I don't want to pile on the opposes, but I cannot support you at this time. My advice would be to work on articles (not just anti-vandalism work); to get involved in RfA discussions (it gives you a good feel of what the community are looking for in their admins); get involved with AfDs/MfDs. -- ''''''''Strong Support'''. Support per selfless OTRS work, strong support per trash in the oppose section. "''Unfortunately, every one of the symptoms is the opposite of what I would want''..." That sort of thing certainly ''is'' unfortunate, but not for the reasons Gigs et al. intended.'''Oppose'''. A good editor and OTRS work is very much appreciated, but too early for adminship as the overall contrib record here at en-wiki is too limited for now. With <3K total edits, I would want to see at least one area of clearly pronounced excellence, and this does not appear to be the case here yet. In particular, I would really like to see a more substantial mainspace contrib record, including at least a few articles created from scratch. For now the most number of edits you made to any individual article is 7 and the most number of edits to an article talk page is 3. You mention [[MarHedge]] as example of your best contributions to Wikipedia. The article itself is basically a stub and you have made 2 edits to it. You did make good arguments in the AfD for this article and it was kept; but still I would want to see something more impressive in terms of best contributions. The projectspace contribution record is also fairly limited, judging from [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Panyd]]. There are no edits listed there to policy talk pages, wikiprojects, ANI, AIV, UAA, etc. While I do not mean to suggest that you should be spending too much time there, I would like to see something. Overall, as I said, a good editor and an asset for the project, but a bit too early for adminship, IMO.'''Oppose''' administrators should be of sound mind.

Best wishes. <small><span style="border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;">'''Oppose''', sorry. For a candidate who has identified AfD as an area of interest as an administrator (which must mean an intention to close AfDs), AfD experience is far too thin. We have to go back to early 2009 to see AfD participation, and the examples there are not inspiring. I understand that the candidate may have experience in consensus-building, but AfD closures require a sound knowledge and understanding of deletion policy. I'm just not seeing that here. I have no doubt that the candidate has been a valuable contributor within the purview of his wikiproject, but I just don't see the breadth of experience that would enable me to be confident of the candidate having the tools. If the candidate proceeds to make some solid contributions in a wider range of admin-like areas, I'd probably be happy to support in a few months. --'''Support''' Looks good, and yes, we ''do'' need more admins in certain time zones. <strong>'''Oppose''' but not because of anything I see particularly wrong. It's more a concern over experience in some admin related areas.

I'm sorry, I just don't feel you have the experience I'd like to see. I see no evidence of article building (rewrites, expansions, maybe an ITN or DYK, perhaps a GA or even FA are all nice to see)- you've never made (at the time of writing) more than 11 edits to a single article in the mainspace. I would also like to see more experience in project space- the number of edits to AIV shows me you're a proficient vandal fighter, but the lack to places like ANI, UAA or RPP doesn't show me that you'd be up to the job of handling anything more serious than petty vandals (though they do need dealing with) or that you keep an eye on pages that you know are vandal targets. I'd be more comfortable supporting in a few months when you have a little more experience, sorry.'''Oppose''' The candidate's anti-vandalism efforts and CSD tagging look fine; however, I don't feel the candidate has enough experience in the project and project talk namespaces for me to judge whether she would make a good administrator outside of the aforementioned areas. The lack of article work is not her favor, either.'''Nope''' Disclose your prior account or forego my support. Evasion of scrutiny is not compatible with my trust, while admitting mistakes and saying what you've learned from them is.'''Neutral''' You do have lots of experience, but I'm not sure if I consider the tool you use as "mainspace" editing.'''Support''' as Nominator. I did notice the Userbox about IP editing when I did my review,  but ignored it as irrelevant to RFA. I think Redthoreau would do a good job of administering the site according to policy. If this was an election to a policy making body then I would be concerned as we are on opposite sides of the IP editing debate. But if we were to turn RFA from a discussion about whether an editor can be trusted with the tools to a WikiPolitics election about their view on policy development then I think it would be bad for the site, both in terms of the way we choose admins and the way we develop policy. Also there are many policy discussions that take place on this site, I often find that editors who disagree with me on one issue agree with me on another. So if this did degenerate into an election for policy makers I expect I'd still have to vote for people who disagreed with me on some policy issues.

The responses to the question are not all that great because they don't seem to spend the time in areas where those questions come up.  This can be gained by (*gasp*) admin coaching, spending time around [[WP:AFD]] to see the discussions and how they are closed, and heck, sometimes just watching [[WP:ANI]] for awhile.  What I'm saying is keep up the current good work, take a lot of positives from this RFA, accept and understand the gentle critiques, and then set out to learn.  Adminship is no big deal, but you seem to have many of the required qualities.  Come back to RFA in a few thousand more edits/6 months or more - but ''not'' until you feel you have a good amount of quality work in the areas that people say you're lacking.

One further concrete thing I can offer now for your consideration if you try again - '''look for a strong nominator''', as many here see a self-nom as a red flag.  Best wishes!

(Which is actually an argument for admin recall/reconfirmation.)---'''Q4 was aced, in my view. I suggest that anyone who disagrees with the block (I don't) nonetheless considers that all important points were covered, and the candidate showed he knows admin misconduct when he sees it. Otherwise, everything looks great. The candidate is clearly an excellent communicator (see edit summaries) which will serve him well with the tools. --'''Support''' Canceling out some of the ridiculous opposes, I don't see a problem with you.'''Support''' Adminship is no big deal. I trust you would use the tools wisely.'''Support'''. I had every intention of voting to oppose based on number of edits. These exercises seem to turn on answering arcane questions of policy sometimes. But they are often about watching the way the candidate handles himself/herself, and the way he/she can handle constructive criticism and suggestions. So I'm going out on a limb, in spite of a low edit count, based on this candidate's response to questions. This candidate has the attitude, flexibility and humility I seek in an admin. Hope you make it.'''Oppose''' – I can't see why he needs the tools. One of the stated uses would be vandlaism fighting; but looking at his <span class="plainlinks">[http://toolserver.org/~soxred93/pcount/index.php?name=Richwales&lang=en&wiki=wikipedia edit figures]</span>, he has made less than five reports to WP:AIV. (WP:AIV doesn't show up on his most edited pages in the Wikipedia name space while the last, and least edited, one on the list has five edits.) If he's rolled back "far more edits than [he] can count", but has only made at most 5 AIV reports then he either misunderstands what vandalism is, or misunderstand AIV. Over a six year period that isn't a lot at all. From a content point of view, well, five new articles in six years isn't what I'd expect. I'd like to see more experience ''at the coal face'' before giving anyone a promotion. I counted ten months, out of the last 70, where the user made more than 100 edits per month, i.e. more than four a day. The activity levels just aren't high enough. We need someone who's around, in touch and contributing. If he gains more experience in AIV, increase his involvement in the project, and produce more content then I would happily reconsider. <span style="white-space:nowrap;">—'''Oppose''' I sample his contributions and immediately find [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Decapitation&diff=prev&oldid=358551297 this edit] to [[decapitation]].  These are quite assertive statements of fact and yet no reference is provided to verify or substantiate them.  The candidate does not seem to have relevant qualifications or expertise which would make him an authority on this topic and so is presenting his own opinion of the topic in an improper way.'''Oppose''' The answers to question 4 and 5 are a failure. Immediately blocking an administrator? Administrators are expected to lead by example, but it is also understood they are human and make occasional mistakes. That's from [[Wikipedia:Administrators]]. That policy page does NOT indicate that administrators should be blocked without warning because they are expected to know proper behavior and being an administrator have already, in effect, been warned. Acting in this manner is far more likely to result in a serious problem than attempting to calm the situation via other means. This elevation of administrators to a higher standard, a higher status is upsetting. Participate more in Wikipedia space, learn the ropes, understand what administrators contend with on a routine basis, and learn to appreciate they aren't any more or less of an editor than anyone else here. --'''Oppose''' - you don't need to be at the top of [[WP:WBFAN]] to be an admin, but you do need to have an idea of the work involved in developing an article. Q4 is also concerning. Candidate needs more experience with the day-to-day affairs of Wikipedia before being granted the tools.'''Oppose'''. I see the potential for you to be an excellent admin (not least in the way you've handled criticism at this RfA): but I do not think that potential will be realised if you pass this RfA. Get some more experience, and try again when you're ready.I don't think you'll be a ''bad'' administrator, but I see several things that I usually don't like seeing at RfA: relatively low activity levels since 2005 (your "record" was 368 edits in one month, and your average is around 100 edits/month), relatively low number of edits to projectspace/projecttalkspace, few edits to [[WP:AIV|AIV]] (as you want to work in vandalism patrol), and relatively low number of edits in general (relative to most RfA candidates that I support, that is). The attitude I have seen from you is something I like, even though I disagree a bit with your answer to Q4. <span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:80%;">'''/Cautious, conscientious, sensible, experienced.  Also, I'm feeling guilty that I gave you a bit of a hard time the last time around :) - Dank ('''Support''' Only concern I found is not enough action taken against vandalism, but that's not much to worry about on top all the good things. --'''Support''' IIRC I first encountered S Marshall when I turned up on his talk page asking for a translation of a French source. He was very helpful, and subsequent interactions confirmed my initial good impression. As others have commented, I believe S Marshall to be a thoughtful editor, as demonstrated by his decision not to get involved in a content discussion when I asked him to provide a translation; I think in that instance stating he had no interest in getting involved in the discussion and that the translation would be his only contribution was a smart move. Using discretion when wielding the tools and knowing which areas you are comfortable to use them in is important. In my opinion content work is a big plus for someone who wants to be an administrator as it shows the candidate is here for the right reasons, ie: writing an encyclopedia. Question 4 suggests a great deal of maturity to me and that S Marshall understands the importance of consensus. As for archiving-box-gate below, I'm not convinced it's worth an oppose, but it does perhaps bear commenting on. The action – while perhaps not the best course – appears to have been taken to stem an unhelpful discussion (something RfA is renowned for, although it wasn't the worst by a long shot); it didn't work out that way and perhaps wasn't necessary, but admins aren't meant to be infallible and if you find one who claims to be they're either joking or deluded. People make mistakes, what's important is learning from them and I'm sure S Marshall will take on Pedro's point about unnecessarily curtailing discussion. Overall, my interactions with S Marshall have left me with the impression of a level-headed, intelligent user who will use the tools sensibly.I wasn't around for the events that led to the necessity of recall/this confirmation, so, like Ged and Giants, I'll base my opinion on what I'm seeing since then, which, for me, is sufficient for my support.  <strong><font color="maroon">'''Support''' Sam left his original account it was messy with blocks, he didn't tell anyone and then went off and became an admin and an arbcom, he was well respected as an arbitrator and as an admin, all he did was leave behind a ''dirty'' account and went on to be a very good editor which he is now and could again be a very good admin, there is nothing left to worry about this editor, I strongly support a bit of forgiveness.'''Support''' I am aware of the history here.

So if any hesiations exist its over that event; howver, theres quality experience and time here building the project. I have to trust that the tools will not be abused.'''Support''' What Hdt83 said. Admins are held to a high standard but it seems, to this completely impartial observer, rather like this nominee is being held to a standard approaching perfection. The nominee is not flawless. He is clearly a bit process-wonky. His canvassing flirted with exceeding acceptable boundaries. He might even be slightly argumentative, but as far as I can tell he maintains a polite, balanced tone when making his point, and his point is generally well backed up. Most importantly, I see no reason to think the tools granted would be abused, and I see some reason to think that the nominee would benefit from access.'''Oppose'''. My only experience of SMcCandlish was in 2007, but it left its mark. It was during a poll to propose the adoption of [[Wikipedia:Attribution]]. I can't remember whether McCandlish opposed the proposal itself or simply the process.

If this is successful I would caution the candidate to start slow. ''<B>--I'd advise applying again in a few months when you can satisfy voters that you have more recent activity, and some additional experience in the areas where you wish to work as an admin. You seem like a fine editor, and I'm sure I'd have no difficulty supporting in those circumstances. &nbsp;No experience in any article review process gets an oppose from me. The GA note above is at best dishonest; you can't take credit on a Ga for an article you didn't really touch. [[User:Wizardman|<span style="color:#030">'''''Wizardman'''''</span>]] <sub>'''Support''' - I see the arguments against, below, but I have never been able to agree.  We need admins to do many admin tasks...if we require every admin to do every task we will deprive ourselves of many good admins.  I have been watching this editor's talk page for some time, seen a lot of good work and reasonable handling of problems.-'''Weak Support''' I'm standing by my previous arguments, although I will note that I think it has not been long enough. I would recommend Thing to be less persistent, and therefore seem more patient, but I do trust him with the tools.--'''Strong Oppose''' - I opposed in your last RfA because I believe that every administrator should have ''some'' content work under their belt in order to have a greater empathy and understanding of the work that other editors are doing. I don't expect FAs, GAs, or even DYKs (and I would be a hypocrite if I did because I'm an admin who doesn't have any of those either). But some example of experience in content creation or at least fixing is necessary for me before I support, and there has been none since then. In fact, your answer to question 4 causes me to oppose stronger than last time; I want someone who ''can'' put thought into their communications with other people, that's critical if you've blocked someone and they want to know what they did wrong. If you lose your train of thought in the middle of a reply, I can't trust that you'll be capable of doing this. I still appreciate reverting vandals, and your quick approach is obviously very successful there, but I'm uncomfortable with you using admin tools in that manner. -- ''''''Oppose'''.  per all the above.  You do some great work for this project, but your lack of edits outside vandal fighting raises a major red flag.  Also, per concerns with judgement, experience, and maturity.  Sorry, '''I really doubt whether you are mature enough for the mop.'''Neutral''' TTTSNB is an extremely prolific vandal-fighter, and he knows how to use the [[WP:RBK|rollback tool]] wisely. His experience in that area makes me confident that he would do a fine job with the block button at [[WP:AIV]] (or even [[WP:UAA]]). But there's more to adminship than just blocking vandals. While I recognize TTTSNB's potential usefulness in a "specialist admin" capacity, the lack of article work is a genuine problem. I am tempted to support only because of TTTSNB's lengthy vandal-fighting experience and because I trust him in general. However, per my preceding comments and the excellent points made by Lear's Fool immediately above, I think I'll stay neutral on this one.CAT:CSD and AIV get more and more backlogged lately. Promoting this candidate will obviously help the project in that respect. The opposes don't explain how their reasons for opposing relate to the candidate's competence as an admin, except for a vague reference to dealing with edit-warring.--'''Support'''. Earlier in my Wiki-career, my opinion was to support good vandal fighters at RfA simply on the grounds that they can make good contributions as administrators, even without content experience. Now—and I say this for the benefit of those who will oppose for lack of content work—I actually have come to think that there is, indeed, the need for candidates to demonstrate that they can deal with arguments in a thoughtful, civil, and articulate way, not simply to be grumpy mouse-clickers. But that doesn't mean that a candidate who hasn't plumbed the depths of the FA process will be unable to be a good administrator. It depends on the candidate, whether or not they communicate intelligently when the IPs complain about being reverted and templated. I need to see that the candidate can be depended upon to reply politely, patiently, and based on policy. So I looked through the candidate's talk page and talk archives. And I support enthusiastically. And opposers who conclude from the lack of content work that this person lacks the temperament to be an administrator haven't done their homework. --'''Strong support''': Regardless of how you put it, TTTSNB would make great use of the admin tools, specially by blocking users. I would've liked to be the one that nominated him, though. <nowiki>;)</nowiki> —'''Support''' Good vandal fighter, seems well rounded enough to become an admin. Btw: I agree with TTTSNB on his stance about Huggle/Twinkle being not so automated as people make them out to be.'''Support''' A distinguished vandal fighter, the candidate's answer to Q2 speaks to a compelling need for the tools.--'''Strongest possible support''' Fantastic vandal fighter, the project would benefit hugely from having The Thing as an admin, I trust the user given the amount of time he has already given to the project.'''Support'''. Thing has worked hard here for a long time, and while more content creation would be a definite plus, I think even without it he has demonstrated sufficient experience and maturity to handle the admin tasks he seeks to do.'''Strong Support''' The Thing is a great vandal fighter, always looking for ways to help. Active user in CVN among other things. --'''Support''' Adminship is no big deal. You seems like a reasonable, level headed fellow and so I give you my support.'''Strong Support''' Thing is one of the most level headed editors I've met here since I started editing "seriously". When tempers get frayed Thing can always be relied upon to attempt to keep it civil.  Thing is also one of the most helpful; on numerous occasions I have seen him (her?) respond with excellent advices to newbies (myself included) seeking more information.  Also, Thing is the epitome of how one should use the various anti-vandal tools on the site (a problem I personally run into frequently).'''Support''' Since picking up again on AIV I have noticed that TTTSNB is one of those filing reports where a review invariably indicates that all boxes are ticked and the buttons just need pushing. Outside of AIV I see a lot of thoughtful comments on the drama boards - I don't always agree, but that is not the issue; application is. Per this Request I notice an applicant who considers it part of the process to make mistakes, recognise them and put them right; if taken into the admin remit this would be a refreshing approach in handling the mop, ''because admins do make mistakes''. So, yup!'''Support''' - moved from [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/The_Thing_That_Should_Not_Be_2&diff=prev&oldid=392159464 neutral] to cancel out some of the more egregious opposes.'''Support'''  Was a bit conflicted on this, but (as per GwenChan) I see a fair bit of indication that this user will not become a tyrant-with-a-block-button. My concerns about deletion were partially ameliorated by some of the diffs the candidate provided (as per WereSpielCheckers). I don't read the "X is more important than Y" diffs the same way some other editors do in context, but I certainly understand and sympathize with why those comments are problematic for many editors. To balance out these negatives, the candidate appears to be a serious force for good here in vandal fighting, you can't "build an encyclopedia" when people are shooting holes in your construction faster than you can build. I'm also glad that the candidate recognizes the problems with the bundling all admin rights not only through his words but through his actions (working on a vandal fighting mini-admin proposal). In the end, I always ask "Do I think I can trust this editor?".  My answer is "yes."  --<font color='#66dd44'>'''Support'''. The Oppose comments are, basically, based on two points: not enough content creation, and something about off-wiki behavior. As to the first, hey, so what? His jones is for fighting vandals. Let's focus on what people ''can'' do for us, not what they ''can't'' do. You known, his comment to the effect that would you rather have all the content creators take two weeks off or all the vandal fighters is, actually, spot on. As to the second, I don't know what is being spoken of, but there are two kinds of bad character markers, those which ''indicate'' a problem and those which ''constitute'' a problem. If his off-wiki behavior was beating up members of the Foundation or strafing the building housing the servers, well, OK; that would constitute a problem. But if his off-wiki behavior was skinning squirrels alive or walking naked in downtown Tulsa, well, who hasn't done that at one time or another? That is only an indicator, and these indicators are often miscontrused. I trust him.'''Weak support''' Ordinarily, I don't support any candidate that doesn't have content work.  However, considering how exceptionally dedicated this Wikipedia is to his anti-vandalism work, I know that the tools would be put to good work.  But one caution, please avoid any controversial deletions; someone who doesn't work with content shouldn't be making the final call in XfD's.  --''''''Support''' per testimony above re: the accuracy of Thing's Huggle work. It's easy to mess up with huggle, so if he's doing it right, let him do all the work. :-) --'''Support'''. I understand that content creation/improvement is key to the project, and hence a number of people have opposed due to this candidate's decision to work in other areas of the project. However, I believe that the project also needs people to remove the vandalism and block those responsible, delete some of the inappropriate articles that get brought to CSD and perform other rather boring tasks without which the project's content would be worthless. That someone is willing to dedicate their time to ensuring that other people's hard sweat is preserved with such accuracy and diligence, thus freeing up content-oriented editors to work on content, is a good enough reason for me to support this candidate.Oh, let the guy fight vandalism.  It's useful work, somebody's got to do it, etc --'''Regretful oppose''' A good user, has reverted my userpage several times, does great anti-vandalism work across the board and will, I'm sure, continue to do so. However, having watched his talk page for some time Thing does not have the detachment and calm needed by an admin, a discussion with Gurch about the - in my view - unnecessary (Custom) appended to every HG revert springs to mind as an example'''Oppose:''' I am not going to put content creation or one little error in for my oppose, but it is a combo of little content creation (Which I think only a bit is needed, not a massive amount, like a GA or 2), the strike back another editor comment made from somewhere around oppose number 15, and a little to fast huggling (concerns of not reading the page enough to do a revert, like the night of the 15th I think it was). --'''Moving from oppose''', as I simply can't justify opposing this editor.'''Oppose''' per Sandy.  Though, I'll also note that there are many others (including those with buttons) who don't know what plagiarism is (and libel, for that matter), but it doesn't seem to deter them from opining.  Still, we have non-lawyers construing legal principles, so perhaps it is expected ... but we have to start somewhere in fixing this.--'''neutral''' seems to have not yet enough around experience yet, such as dealing with a fair use situation yet.'''Oppose''' [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buckhorn_middle_school&oldid=387594621 This] is simply awful use of A1.  How can  something with an address, name, town, phone number, and zip code EVER be insufficient context to identify the subject?  It can't, end of story.  As you also left the G11 tag, I'm going to hold you accountable for that poor decision as well, as that article wasn't a G11 candidate either.'''Neutral'''. Whether TransporterMan would be a good admin I cannot say. My one interaction with him was at the [[Michael Levin]] article, which came after I posted a request for a third opinion; take a look at that article's talk page if you want to see what happened. TransporterMan's intervention was basically helpful, since it did resolve a dispute over article content between myself and another editor. It seemed to me, however, that TransporterMan was much too quick to comment on the situation, and frankly didn't properly understand what the dispute was about; he could and should have made an effort to clearly understand the particulars of the dispute before commenting. I suppose that if you give third opinions regularly you wind up commenting on a very large number of disputes, which may make things difficult to follow; the more disputes you take an interest in, the less time you have to focus on each one of them. We obviously need editors to give third opinions, but if you do so much of it that your understanding of individual cases is somewhat off, then that could potentially defeat the purpose of the exercise.Sorry without discussion on temporay adminship, i have to oppose.{{ec}}'''Oppose''' Without a discussion and agreement on temporary adminship, I can't support. There would be no way to enforce this (in theory, a steward could say "Oh, the consensus was to remove it after 30 days *click*" but there is no way to ensure this happens. What if they contact you and you say "No, everyone else gets it for life, I have changed my mind"? It is too uncertain as to what would/could/should happen. This just seems like a [[WP:POINT]]y RfA. -- ''''''''Strong support'''. In the few months I've been his admin coach, I have found him to be a reasonable and trustworthy person.

Nonetheless I'd counsel the candidate to avoid such odd edits as the ones that have been linked in this and the oppose section.

Shall we just write off those requests because they were opportunistic? Honest answer to Q3 too.

He has been less active of late, but not so much so that he has lost his grasp of policy; I have no concerns in that area after reviewing the answer to question 8.  The flippant edit summaries are in a gray area between sardonic wit and sarcastic smackdown, but I'm pretty sure that he will err on the side of caution no matter which way this RfA goes - he gets it.--'''~'''Oppose''' Sorry I'm a big fan of Edit summary's ( my pet peeve ). You need to change your current habits on that issue.'''Oppose''': It’s all about the right kind of experience and you don’t have it yet.  You said ''I would work with deletion'' yet you’ve only created 4 new articles in your entire WP experience.  Three of those are still stubs and one has been tagged for notability and references for a year [[Blue_Ridge_Mountains_Council|here]]. Yet, you believe you are qualified to delete other editor’s work when you haven’t proven you even know how to create a quality WP article.  Frankly you've have not demonstrated through content creation that you understand how WP works and will give new editors the benefit of the doubt when judging their early creations.   An admin’s role is part of the quality improvement cycle of the encyclopedia and that role is far more encompassing than merely deleting stuff.    This may seem harsh, but I suspect you are reacting to these comments exactly the way many new editors react when their first article is nominated for deletion immediately after they’ve created it.  Sustain your passion for WP, but spend some serious time creating serious content.--{{ec|4}} '''Oppose''' – with regret. Five months without a block is long enough to show you have improved in general editing, but not nearly enough time to prove suitability for adminship. It just doesn't follow.

You answered part of "why" on the first part (why is BLP exempt from 3RR) but only answered "what" on the second part (NOR, NPOV, etc, can be taken to talk.  Why?)  But that aside, the answer bothers me that you are being too literal on BLP.  BLP, if anything, should be broadly interpreted (see [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Footnoted_quotes/Proposed_decision#Special_enforcement_on_biographies_of_living_persons|special enforcement]]).  If, for example, you are considering a 3RR complaint where one user has reverted a sourced, but tangential rant about a person (ie, Bob was a member of organization X in college last year.  Organization X's leader was convicted of a crime last year.  Here are 37 other things organization X has done over the years), that doesn't fall under "libellous, biased, unsourced, or poorly sourced controversial material" (because we're presupposing that every individual statement in there is sourced) but it darn well should be removed and no wikilawyering should result in it being a part of the article. [[Wikipedia:Coatrack]] is a good read.  The point is, we should err far on the side of protecting BLPs.  That's where IAR comes in.

The answer to the "rights" question is succinct but no less correct for that and the response to the question about recall is the simplest and clearest explanation I have read about the terribly flawed recall procedure. I would, however, recommend editing Wikipedia while enjoying a tipple or two! --'''Weak Support'''. As I said during his last RfA, Backslash Forwardslash has the potential to be a good admin. I would have preferred he acquire a bit more experience since then, but he's done much to address my prior concerns.'''Neutral''' — Someone who can't think of a specific change they'd like to make to a policy, probably hasn't spent enough time thinking about Wikipedia's policies.  I'm also not seeing enough participation in collaborative or contentious areas such as DRV, AfD, dispute resolution etc. for my taste... but I don't feel I can oppose because I do think this candidate has the right temparament and attitude for adminship.—Solid editor that has established he can be trusted with the tools.

For my complete views on it, see [[WT:RFA]]</small> BobtW gave an answer that is pretty by the book, and thus lends itself to an easy support. It showed a level head and concrete thinking, however, BobtW did not address the BLP issue at all, which was a critical aspect of all of this. (To BobtW's credit, he pointed out the RS issue) Administrators must keep the end goal (the production of good content) in mind when dealing with poor conduct. Recent months have shown fairly conclusively that BLP errors are ticking time bombs. I still vote to support because I believe BobtW will take my advice on this manner and accept it as a learning moment and has demonstrated traits that suggests that he is dedicated to keeping things in proper perspective.--'''Support'''  I particularly like his honest answer to Q11 - an admin should be chosen if we trust him or her to use the additional tools responsibly, and ''not to use'' them when he/she is unsure or conflicted. I have confidence that Bob will live up to that standard. All the best.After some discussion on my talk page, I see no reason to oppose, but I do not support because I  think it is good for a candidate to be at least a little comfortable with all major areas. '''Liked what I saw in a quick review, like the answers to the questions.  CSD tagging was solid and I liked how he handles different scenarios there (including declining at least two of his own CSD tags over the past month where he decided another option was better.)  The fact that he will reconsider his own tags and reverse himself is a positive, not a negative, especially when dealing with CSD.---''''''Support''' - Levelheaded, trustworthy, and hardworking editor. I see no reason to oppose that.I came across CactusWriter during a GA reassessment of [[Haraldskær Woman]]. (S)he responded politely and promptly to a situation that many react to defensively, and worked to save that article's GA status. Without that personal experience I might have been inclined to oppose based on a lack of content building, and in particular exposure to the independent review processes, but I'm satisfied the candidate knows what (s)he's doing, so no worries. --'''Support'''. Seems to be a reasonable user. So why not? --'''Support''' Impressive afd work. Would be a good help in the Xfd arena.--'''Support''' as I see nothing which raises any flags or causes me to believe this editor would abuse the tools. Twiddle the bit. ···'''Support'''. I am going to have a closer look at your contributions later, but I'm very happy with what I've seen so far. I have no problem with primarily huggle-based editors becoming admins, providing that the huggle work is of a generally high standard of accuracy. In your case I haven't seen any mistakes as yet, and generally you seem to handle it very effectively - and from the number of AIV reports that ended up being submitted (and subsequently blocked, allowing you to block directly would free up a lot of time for other admins. Your contributions to AfD debates have also generally seemed intelligent, logical and in many cases add new arguments or sources to the discussion rather than just jumping on a delete bandwagon. Combine that with some very good question answers and enough content work to at least demonstrate you know this is an encyclopedia -  I feel very happy to support at this time. ~ <font color="#228b22">'''Support''' Sure, you huggle a lot, but your messages to other users on their talk page and yours show me that you're clueful and intelligent.  Such people are capable of learning administrative areas.

Edit counts don't concern me necessarily, though the small number of talk edits (the user talk edits are probably almost all warnings) is slightly troubling.  No other red flags though, so I support.'''Support''' I'm very impressed with the user's answers and level of maturity and respect in this RfA. Arguments above seem to outweigh those below, so I can't oppose. Good luck with the tools if this pulls through! ~ '''<font size="2">Camw will be okay: just take it slow, and don't hesitate to ask more experienced users for help.'''Weak Oppose'''. Pretty much the same thing I said at [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Mikaey|Mikaey's concurrent RFA]], you're on your way, but I need to see more than Huggling. Adminship requires knowledge of policy, civility, clue, and so forth, and you may have tons of each, but it is difficult to tell with your contributions as they currently stand. For example, you say in Q1 you want to work on RFPP, but you have only four edits there. Get some more experience in the project space and I look forward to supporting in the future.'''Somewhat oppose''' I would give you merit for your edits, but your edits in Huggle are a tad much.'''Oppose'''. Too dependent on automated tools. There is no way to fully acknowledge that the candidate has a grasped our policies.'''Neutral''' Seems like a good candidate, but there aren't enough non-hg edits to judge how they would use the tools.  For the candidate, this is easy to fix!  I agree with several other editors here that if you spend some time on noticeboards (especially the underserved ones, not AN & AN/I), policy talk pages and article work (specifically, pick something and see if you can bring it to GA or FA), you will do well.  This may seem like checking boxes or "leveling up", but it isn't.  If you are genuinely interested in learning how this place works and judging how consensus, dispute resolution and content improvement are helped or hindered by the tools, those are all valuable processes to undergo.  Even if the ''process'' itself doesn't enlighten you, you will meet new people and discover new corners of the wiki ([[Wikipedia:Database reports]] is a good place to work, or [[Wikipedia:Articles for creation]], or any of the peer review systems).  You will run into conflicts, resolve them, help users, shepherd newbies, and by the time you are done, people will wonder why you aren't an admin.  So please, if this RfA doesn't succeed, take it as some constructive feedback from a community that wants and needs your help across all of the encyclopedia.'''Neutral Leaning to Oppose'''. After seeing you're count, I'm very.....confused I guess you could say. You have been here for four years...but you had done nothing over a quater of the time. You had a couple edits here and there and then all of a sudden you started reverting vandalism. Also, you have done over 10,000 edits in just 3 months, but the number means nothing, it's about the experience, and right now you're just the same as a person who has been here for 3 moths posting an RFA. But at the same time, you didn't have dumb answers. It looked and sounded like you actually knew what you were talking about. But 3 months of editing just isn't right to me.'''F***ing Strong Support''' &mdash; God, I've seen this one coming for a ''long'' time. Chamal is an exceptional editor and writer, he is a great help over at [[WP:HD|the help desk]], and he'll make a fantastic administrator. ''WAY'' overdue!'''Support''' - I am willing to assume that the copyright problem is a one-off issue, and if he is anything like I am, he has probably exhaustively reviewed the relevant pages as a result of the criticism he has received in this RfA. No issues besides that.'''Neutral''' for now, pending the answer to ThaddeusB's questions and others. I'm a bit concerned with his answer to question 4, and his discomfort and professed unfamiliarity with the AfD process makes me worried that he might not understand Wikipedia's inclusion criteria which I consider very important for an administrator, whether or not he plans on getting involved in AfDs. -- ''''''Strong Support''' Very level headed, eager to improve himself, excellent at discussions, involvement in policy discussions.

''''''Oppose''' Cobi's lack of interaction in the "Normal" encyclopaedia leads me to question his experience. Cluebot is very good, but we expect admins to be able to identify behaviours which are not simply codifiable. For example, (nearly) anyone can identify a simple 3RR, but this does not approach the full scope of edit warring behaviours. There is no question about the value of Cobi's contributions within his narrow scope, but I don't think he even approaches enough experience to become an admin. I would like to see at least one serious banging of heads over content to show that he is aware of the "Normal" to-and-fro of hotheadedness which accompanies article editing.'''Oppose''' Per John Vandenberg and others. I am not a believer in the notion that an editor must be an article writer to be trustworthy, but I don't trust someone whose contribs are almost entirely automated edits. A large part of adminship is people skills, and I don't see any evidence of that. Feel free to respond and convince me otherwise, and I might switch to support. <font style="font-family: Hoefler Text">'''Oppose''', lack of content development and debate.

Sure, I still have some concerns, notably about CSD.

He might make some mistakes now and then, but who doesn't?  He won't abuse the tools.'''Support''' x 0.9999999... Good contributor and seems to be able to cope with flak. ''''''Support''' After reading all questions, answers and comments I found no reason to oppose.'''Oppose''' - I will have to oppose too, as I just can't overlook the fact that you haven't been active in CSD (or much at all) in quite a few months. I agree with Wisdom and Balloonman, CSD is one of those places where we can't be promoting administrators who learn while working on it. In addition, the lack of communication shown above is even more of an offputter. Surely you could have pointed him ''somewhere''. If I were a new editor in those shoes, I would see that as exceedingly unfriendly. Put together with the many "per" links by Balloonman, I will have to oppose.'''Weak Oppose''' I'm very very sorry, but I have to agree with Pharoah of the Wizards here. You're clearly a great editor, but I'm just not sure adminship is right at the moment. I would strongly encourage you to run in the future, though; you've clearly got enough clue for the job, all that's lacking is a bit of experience.I'm sticking with neutral.  Balloonman's comment influenced me the most on this one, especially the bit about your AfD contributions.

We are here to build a comprehensive, accurate and ''readable'' reference work.'''Oppose'''. I don't see experience in the administrative areas you say you would be involved in, and while prose problems in the mainspace are of secondary concern, it is vital that administrators be able to communicate with other editors effectively. I don't see evidence of that in your writing here, and you've made several errors in your answers to Q1 and Q2. I think you have also erred in your treatment of those who raised concerns on the talk page. Your responses seem to be alternatively combative and dismissive, rather than collaborative.

Re: Durova's [[Number the Stars]] example, at first sight it's absurd that anyone could edit the article 77 times yet leave only two references, but IMO it's excusable in this case because most of the content is plot summary/list of characters—and a lot of Franamax's edits were reverts after vandalism. -'''Support''' - This is probably too late, but what the heck.

[[WP:NOTNOW]]--'''Oppose''' - I judge RfA candidates on three criteria: their commitment to Wikipedia/experience, their clue level, and their interaction with other users. While I see no major issues in any area, Fribbler's relative inactivity is bothersome.  Additionally, the answers to the questions were accurate but failed to demonstrate an understanding of why policy is the way it is. I don't doubt his intelligence, nor has he made any serious errors in the past.  However, the culture and expectations of Wikipedia change over time and I don't see someone of his activity level being aware of the changing cultural standards.  That relative inactivity combined with a desire to work in speedy deletion causes me to oppose.  Practically speaking, there are nearly no checks and balances on an admin's speedy deletions.  A bad speedy can scare away a potential contributor and it just isn't worth the risk giving that ability to someone who has so little use of the tools anyway. (I.e., because he won't be around that often).  --'''Support''' – en.wikipedia needs more WikiGnomes as sysops, as they tend to pay greater attention to detail for the smallest things, whether it be fixing templates, placement, etc. Also per solid, sensible contribs at AFD.

Per BirgitteSB's discomfort about approach to issues, which I share. Per TFMWNCB's discomfort about approach to BLP, which I share. I could have let one or two of these slide but in total, no. Note that at this point I believe it's likely, or at least possible, that Geni will pass. But I want these matters to remain in Geni's awareness, in the hope that by having this awareness... that there ARE issues... that there ARE concerns that others have... will moderate his approach and temper his actions with caution. ++'''Neutral''' - I really, ''really'' want to support.

The fact that it took '''months''' to get their sandbox moved back into their userspace is also troubling, as that would not have been particularly difficult to accomplish, especially for an editor with the tenure of Hawkeye7. That this did not take at most an hour to accomplish, brings into question how well this candidate understands how Wikipedia works, and thus I cannot support this user gaining the bit. The recent fluctuations in monthly edit counts, with no accompanying explanations on the user or user talk pages is a more minor issue. You're an amazing content creator though.  --'''Oppose'''.

I've supported many RFA candidates, but this one is the strongest support I've ever given to an RFA candidate so far!Considering that no one really informed him of the username policy until May 2009[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Materialscientist&oldid=291743127#Usernames] (the only person who did so before was blocked soon after[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Materialscientist&oldid=291743127#Hello][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Lambmeat]), and that he renamed soon after learning about the username policy[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Materialscientist&diff=291765884&oldid=291743127], it is hard to hold that against him. In addition, it seems that the committee behind the account abandoned it to one person much earlier than that.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Materialscientist&diff=265250255&oldid=264205270] But besides that whole issue, Materialscientist is a wonderful editor who will do great with the mop. At my [[Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Nikita_Zotov/archive1|first FAC on Nikita Zotov]], he gave a review that essentially said, "You must find far more sources in Russian, or this article should not pass FAC". As I had no knowledge of the Russian language at all, Materialscientist kindly took a great deal of time to find sources[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nikita_Zotov#Possible_sources] and do translations of some old works that Google was useless for[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nikita_Zotov#Translation_requested].

After past experiences with MZMcBride, I had thought that I would not support him in a million years. Us two have not had the best of relationships. I have changed my mind. Ever since MZMcBride was desysopped, I have constantly told him that it's a mistake. I feel that Wikipedia lost a great admin a few months ago, and I have always wanted him back on the team. (Additionally, I am spending my only 10 available minutes on the computer right now to support this RfA) <small>('''Strong support''' - I think the time off was needed as I could see MZM was getting burnt out but I think now is the time to give him back the tools.

Seriously though, 5 months ago I was one of the most outspoken, and harshest critics that MZ had.  As an IT guy, I ''do'' understand the satisfaction in relating to databases, scripts, programing languages and computers in general.  You only get back the information you put in.  With people, especially via the Internet where there is no voice inflection, no visual clues to intent, humans can be unpredictable, given to emotional and sometimes illogical responses. (see [[GIGO]]).  The fact that MZM has worked so hard to "communicate", and to seek community consensus over his own beliefs has impressed the hell out of me.  It would be foolish to question his strong desire to improve the Wikipedia project, or deny the devotion of his efforts here.  While human interaction may be a second language to MZ, his ability to master it, simply should not be ignored.  As an editor who may be on the opposing side of "deletion" discussions outside of BLP space, I believe that in the ''present'', to deny MZ the tools would effectively [[Hamstring#Injury|hamstring]] the entire project.  I'm not in favor of asking a person to work with one hand tied behind their back.

We may never get "walls of text" from Mr. McBride, but there are a few folks here that can pick up that end of things. What we will get is an honest, and dedicated effort to improve our project, as well as a strong individual who can help us move forward in the years ahead. — <small><span style="border:1px solid #000000;padding:1px;"><b>'''Support''', although I would have easily voted to desysop him twice (in fact, I fault last year's ArbCom for failing to do so in the Palin wheel war case).

At the same time, we should also grant it more liberally than RFA has in recent years. After thorough questioning, I'm convinced that MZMcBride will not make the ''same'' mistakes.

Like Ali'i above, opposed him losing them in the first place - good faith editor and hard worker.MZMcBride did make some mistakes before he lost his adminship, especially in his communication.

To the extent I have personal recollections of MZMcBride's admin work, they are good ones, but we are now in the rare position of discussing a candidate whose judgment as an administrator has been found to be flawed by ArbCom twice, at [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/MZMcBride#Findings of fact]] (April 2009) and [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Sarah Palin protection wheel war#Reduction of protection by MZMcBride]] ( October 2008). Under these circumstances, I am uncomfortable with supporting his candidacy. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">'''Oppose''' I am one of those people who believes past actions are the best indicator of future behavior.  If the "secret page" deletions had been an isolated incident of poor judgment, I could overlook it, but MZ's history as a sysop was one of regularly pushing the boundaries of both the rules and social norms.  I won't repeat all the incidents here, but [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/MZMcBride/Evidence|his ARBCOM case's evidence]] and [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Sarah Palin protection wheel war/Evidence|the Sarah Palin wheel war case]] outline most of them.  Perhaps he has genuinely changed, but I am uncomfortable with re-sysoping.  I see a significant possibility that he will slowly begin to push the boundaries again when he thinks he can get away with it.  I also find it hard to believe that one of the most active admins of all time is running "mostly to do routine maintenance." --'''Oppose''' This is all new to me, but the concerns above, plus apparently no burning need for the tools, say no.  It is hard to dislodge malfunctioning admins & I'm wary of then re-admitting them quickly.'''Oppose'''. It's impossible to evaluate a candidate with four years of tenure and 60k+ edits by looking at Special:Contributions. I feel that the best I can do is to look at MZMcBride's former RfAs, the arbitration case, his answers to the questions in this RfA, and the testimonials of people who have interacted with him. Naturally, I do think that the mass deletions were very, very, unfortunate, and goes against every principle I have about how an administrator should conduct herself. However, it is clear from the amount of support, that MZMcBride does a lot of good work in various areas of the project, and is generally a friendly and helpful person. I still feel that it'd be better to appoint administrators that do not come with the sort of "baggage" that MZMcBride comes with. If I'm not mistaken, he is still under active restrictions imposed by the Arbitration Committee. Many supporters make good arguments for why he should regain the tools, not least the nominator, who[m] I very much respect. However, I cannot overlook the strong arguments brought forth by the opposition, in particular S Marshall, Joe Hiegel, ThaddeusB, Durova, and Maedin.

Orlady can be depended upon to do necessary tedium.--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] <small>([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|c]]/'''Strong Oppose''' - Unlike other opposing editors who have had long term experience of Orlady's style, I have had only one central encounter with her, which culminated with [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Orlady&oldid=282643840#A_question this exchange] (bottom half). So the exhanges I am reacting to can be followed though from there. I notice that defenders of Orlady are defending her '''actions'''. I don't think her actions are what is at issue here; it is her tone. She has an exceptionally confrontative style, the style of a zealot who becomes swept away with her cause and feels no holds are barred. Once she gets her head of steam, she tries to flatten everything in her path. Orlady is intelligent, and if she becomes an administrator, I do not doubt that she will pursue transgressors relentlessly and run them into the ground, and do it in a way that does not violate the Wikipedia guidelines. But I think, and this may be a minority view, that an administrator should also posses some pastoral and communication skills, including  core respect and sense of proportion when dealing with other people. I would support Orlady in a future RfA if she showed, in the intervening time, that she was aware of these issues and was making progress in that direction. In fact, if she developed more appropriate communication skills, she would make an excellent administrator. But as it stands, she would be a disaster, leaving a trail of unnecessary wreckage in her wake. --[[User:Geronimo20|Geronimo20]] ([[User talk:Geronimo20|talk]]) 03:49, 9 April 2009 (UTC). Addendum: Not to mention motivated sockpuppets. --'''Oppose'''.  This is about speedy deletion—there's the fact that she started an RFA without a clear understanding of the way speedy deletion works, and there's the fact that she seems to have answered a direct question about it at her RFA before gaining that understanding.<p>I realise Orlady says she doesn't intend to do work with speedy deletion, but unfortunately, admins have tenure, it's unreasonably difficult to get rid of a maverick one, and once given the tools, there's nothing restricting what work they do; so I feel it's only prudent to assess my !vote as if she were proposing to work with speedy deletion.<p>To me, the fact that Orlady is trying to answer speedy deletion-related questions without understanding the consensus about how it works doesn't bode well at all.  It suggests that as an admin, she would do as she feels is right rather than in accordance with the community's normal procedure, and I'm afraid that's a very grave concern to me.—'''oppose''' abrasiveness in writings on this page indicate to me a poor temperament for this role.'''Oppose''' - When I originally looked at this RfA I was not sure if I was going to go with an oppose, or a neutral. After looking over some of the other opposes, they seem to be concerned about the same things I am and as such I must oppose. Because this (like Cobra said) is coming down to the wire, I feel I needed to voice my opinion. Should this still be open when I get home today I will add more. For now, the basis for my oppose is based upon my overall impression of Orlady. That being, I fear she will be heavy handed when issuing blocks, protecting articles, and dealing with sockpuppets. Also, I get a feeling that she feels this site is a [[WP:BATTLE|battle ground]] and to be honest I am a bit curious as to why Orlady posted a link to attack page about herself. On top of that some of the concerns brought up about her AfD participation worries me, and leads me to believe there is a potential for drama surrounding closures that she would make. Finally, Stifle brings up a good point. The interaction with others in this RfA only reinforces others concerns about temperament and abrasiveness.(Changed from support) Orlady is a dedicated contributor, but the concerns brought up in the oppose section are too strong to ignore, I'm afraid. Remaining neutral so as not to pile on. –''''''Support''' You definitely seem to be sufficiently experienced in the areas you say you want to work in.

I think Pastor Theo's real-life experience would serve him well in the role of administrator.

If you had chosen a secular user name, with a few religious userboxes on your page, I suspect that you would not be questioned so much about hypotheticals.

I am generally in agreement with several of the other oppose votes above, especially after reading the diff presented by Iridescent. Given how many admin-related issues today involve BLP and other content issues, I would also like to see more content contributions.'''Oppose''' per lack of well-rounded experience writing articles, maybe down the road apiece...'''Oppose''' - per Iridescent's diff. Project does not need another member of the Civility Brigade offering condescending self-righteous tsk-tsking during heated debate - especially not one armed with the tools. Hastily throwing cold water on any and every heated debate leaves us with nothing more than lukewarm results.'''Neutral''' My only interaction with Pastor Theo was during Majorly's RfA. In it, I became concerned by his interpretation that "berating a long-time contributor" was inappropriate. As well as his oversensitivity to the berating, I was also concerned about the mention of the subject being a "long-term contributor": all editors are equal regardless of longevity. Although Pastor Theo avoided referring to [[WP:CIVIL]], I am concerned about giving this user the ability to block others. However, competence at CSD and XfD attested to by Balloonman, PT's general cluefullness (which I think is demonstrated by his careful handling of religious articles to rule out suggestions of a conflict of interest), and his response to question one where he states his intention to work in areas of deletion rather than blocking means I do not think this a reason to oppose on its own. Despite this, I do not support giving the ability to block to someone apparently so sensitive. Since PT has apparently not been in any stressful run-ins with other users I cannot be certain how he would handle the situation were it to arise (and active admins do have to deal with a lot of abuse).I never knew Patar knight is as young as he is: I've seen him around many times before, and always thought that he has good judgment, and that he was older. Regarding "stressful adminship situations", the only people who find adminship stressful are admins who seek out drama: regular admin work has hardly brought about any stress in my own experience and in the experience of other admins I've asked about stress. He's been on Wikipedia for nearly three years it seems too, and he's familiar with what's going on here.'''Support''' I have worked with this editor for a couple of years at Milhist and always found him unfailingly courteous, hardworking, and sensible. He's not going to rush around breaking things. With a wise head on young but broad shoulders, he'll make a fine addition to the admin corps. &nbsp;'''Oppose''' - Sorry. It's the age thing. While we obviously have many excellent administrators who are under 18--several of whom I would consider friends--I don't believe Wikipedia should promote any more, period. Admins must, to a lesser extent than Oversighters, deal with potentially legally-sensitive information. Were that information to be leaked out of Wikipedia (as has happened at times, I don't have links handy), any legal ramifications (particularly civil suits( could fall upon the minor's parents. I don't think that's something we should be encouraging; people must be responsible for their edits here, and the capacity to view sensitive deleted information brings with it the capability to do something with that information. At least if an admin is over 18 they are legally responsible for their own actions, in both the criminal and civil sense. Don't get me wrong, you seem to be a fine contributor and not in the slightest bit prone to any rashness. I just think we should have a bright-line policy about anyone with extra buttons required to be over the age of majority in the jurisdictions in which Wikipedia is legally incorporated. Won't happen, of course, but still. //'''Oppose''' The answer to Q13 is vague and doesn't give clue: here, as for most of the questions, it lacks examples (actual or hypothetical) and especially diffs, which would help to see beyond the somewhat by-rote and insubstantial responses. As for Q12, differentiating by age of a minor is ''not'' comparable to doing so by gender, race, religion etc - the reasons as outlined by Roux (and by other editors/admins elsewhere) explain why. Whereas the extent of these potential issues and risks are open to  interpretation and debate, it is ostrich-like - if not willfully and stubbornly dismissive - to insist that they don't exist at all and that to hold otherwise is unfairly discriminatory. That the candidate chooses to use this its-discrimination-like-all-the-others argument and then direct that such opposes be considered invalid is telling. Yes, it is frustrating but who should want adminship so much to run such risks anyway?I am concerned about the lack of understanding at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mariofan110]]. Anyone can remove a CSD tag. Even if we believe it is obviously speediable. Even if we believe it's a sock.'''Support'''. An excellent candidate.

Not convinced by the opposes. Per Tan et al.It's been stated that Ronhjones has some 5,000 or so edits that weren't made with an tool such as Huggle: 5,000 edits is easily enough to judge whether someone will make a bad admin or not. He's created 17 articles? That good! Never voted in an RfA before either? That's good as well: admins aren't required to participate in RfAs, and his answers are more likely to be genuine rather than puffed to pass RfA. Having a high percentage of automated edits doesn't make someone untrustworthy, especially when when they have several thousand non-automated edits in addition to the edits with tools. In addition, Ronhjones would have to make several thousand non-automated edits to have them be equal in percentage with automated ones, and then several thousand more for a 3-to-1 non_automated-to-automated ratio (and even 25% automated edits can still be too much for some people, and bear in mind he'd have to cease all automated editing to get those percentages).

I know it happens more than I realize, but I get profoundly uncomfortable with extended admin coaching and grooming processes - reminds me of politicians and their handlers rather than people who can be trusted with mops. I have little insight into the nominee's behavior and whether he is trustworthy, but I find the nom itself to be quite offputting and the discussion on the page around the purported misjudgement too focused (already at the time - Dec 2008) on to what extent this puts the nominee's trek to adminship at risk. If this nom were currently in the gray zone, I would not oppose on these grounds (rather stay silent or neutral), but since consensus seems to currently be very positive, I feel I am not being unfair in explicitly raising my concern. I wish the nominee all the best of luck, but would be much more comfortable with his having the mop if he stopped being coached, just acted his natural wiki-self for a few months, and then reapplied.I can tell just from the writing style in his answers that he'll be great.

Sorry.I was going to make a neutral comment, but looking a bit further, I'm going to have to oppose. 80-odd mainspace edits just isn't enough article experience and honestly, the article edits I looked at left me with a number of concerns. Leaving aside your various user subpages, you have nearly as many edits (73) to User:95jb14 than you do to articles! Neither is 80 project edits sufficient. Outside this RFA, all your project edits seem to be to wikiprojects with none in any admin-related areas. While you started editing in September 2008, until June this year you only averaged about 11 edits per month and then after June 2009, you've averaged about 115 edits a month (overall its about 48 per month). I'm not just looking strictly for edit numbers but also their quality, but this really is not enough for you to get sufficient experience or for me to get a good picture of you and evaluate your suitability for adminship. Also note that most "admin jobs" don't actually need access to admin tools and can be done by non-admins, and if you wish to be an admin, it would be good if you got some experience with that sort of work. Your answer to question 1 is a bit concerning and I suspect from it that you don't have a great understanding of the role of administrators on Wikipedia. You said: "I learn quickly and will enjoy the privilages". Adminship is just a maintenance-type job ("a janitor") rather than a privilege to be enjoyed. You also said you would like to fight vandalism, help new users and give advice, but you don't need to be an admin to do any of this work and you can do it now as a regular contributor. I feel you need much more and broader experience and I would encourage you to get more involved and join in community discussions, as well as doing a lot more article content work before returning to RFA. Addit: Sorry, I was going to be neutral, but I've noticed you also seem to be [[:File:Screenshot 95jb14.jpg|using]] non-free content (which includes the copyright WP logo and name, the Microsoft Windows logo and a bunch of other copyright logos at the bottom) decoratively on your userpage in violation of [[WP:NFCC]], and all up I feel there's enough reason to oppose.'''Oppose''' I have to oppose on grounds of lack of experience. With regard to Graeme's comment above, lack of civility and contempt among Admins. is a major issue for me and it seems to be an increasing trait. Keep your nose clean before your next RfA and always consider how you would like to be addressed and how you would feel if someone was uncivil towards you. It wouldn't be tolerated face to face and nor should it be across the ether. Keep up your efforts.'''Oppose'''. Lack of experience alone should have made this a NOTNOW closure, I would have thought. Normally I wouldn't pile on, but "They are tits, idiotic twats who don't care for anyone but they're own shitty reputation and disrespect and corrupt everything that exists in wikipedia"? And now you want to ''be'' one of these twats?I find your enthusiasm and desire to help absolutely wonderful, and from what I can see you are learning about a number of different ways to do so around Wikipedia (e.g. improving articles, vandal fighting, working with templates).  Other editors here have expressed that you have a good record, and what you've done already is really the only way to judge how you would do with admin tools.  I believe a larger edit history under your belt will make it easier for people to support you, but to my knowledge there is no age requirement for this position.  Keep up the good work.--'''Neutral''' per [[WP:NOTNOW]], but thank you for your commitment and please do get a few more thousand edits under your belt. We need you!'''Support'''. I think that it strains [[WP:AGF]] to assume that a candidate is hiding something nefarious in his/her past just because they fail to disclose a previous username. The editcounts caught my eye as well, and I was curious about the previous username (indeed, the candidate's current name highlights the fact that it's new). The answer to question 4 satisfies my curiousity on that point. As for the rest - I'm seeing good work overall, no concerns from me there. Overall, a quality candidate whom I'm pleased to support.'''Support''' - no major concerns at this time. I would advise though, whether this RFA succeeds or fails, that you change your username - 'A new name 2008' draws attention to your prior account, and arguably implies that people are supposed to know which it is.

Looking through your user talk, you seem to remain civil enough (although I feel you could take an extra minute to explain things in more depth for newbs). But naturally you're not perfect :D. I would like to see an improvement in article building. To really understand AfD, you need to create some good articles which get nominated for deletion, IMO (I saw you have one recent AfD warning on your usertalk, but you didn't take part in the AfD and I can't see how much you really edited the page). From their previous experience they should be able to manage in the areas they wish to take part in to start off with (deletion). And I also think they could cope with blocking (although I appreciated that you seem to want to start ff slow).

I figured that he was an admin. From his actions, he always seemed to me as not assuming good faith, quick to judge in an overly harsh way, condoning problematic administrative behavior, and doing everything that I absolutely oppose in an administrator. I always had in mind to run an RfC against him with a proposal of desysopping. This RfA actually made me happy because I realized that the user never actually had the sysop bits to go through with what I see as actions that would only damage this encyclopedia. Thus, I am opposing with the hope that he is never, ever, given ops because I 100% feel that this user cannot be trusted to use the tools in a way that is best for Wikipedia. This is from my experience viewing them only in their discussions and reactions at ANI over the course of a very long time.'''Regretful Oppose''', I've never personally disagreed with this user, from what I can recall, but from the responses of others that I've seen on AN/ANI, they're far too divisive.

I appreciate the need to try to balance Wikipedia with everything else, and I acknowledge the recognition and apology over an error. We all make mistakes. How we deal with the fallout is something that decides our suitability for adminship. Adminship can be the toughest and most enjoyable volunteer job imaginable. It is very demanding of time and energy. You will need to maintain a fairly high activity level just to stay sharp and keep up with changes.

The mistake wasn't that severe and whilst admins are supposed to be role models for good behaviour, no one can be perfect all of the time. He stated it won't happen again, I trust that. Also, SSP *needs* someone like E-man (diligent, hard-working, good attention-to-detail).Mostly per iridescent; sure, it wasn't the best thing to do, but if he was an admin already everybody would treat it as a minor issue, especially stuff like changing warnings on your own talk page. I mean, seriously. He seems like a pretty intelligent and good candidate in all other respects.'''Support''' Enigmaman has made overall good contributions to Wikipedia, a lapse of judgment notwithstanding. I don't feel said lapse of judgment mars his ability to be a good administrator in the future, especially seeing how well he has responded in a stressful situation.

However, the fiasco regarding log-out edits confuses me a lot and I still don't figure out what is the real beef on the matter. Sadly, we have a lot of uncivil admins (saying more rude comments than the "idiot" comment by the candidate) who made edit wars, so I think the deleted links should be explained. Since it is reopened, the b'crat in charge of the hold should notify all previous voters about the case and at least summarize it at the top of this page? (I'm not gonna spend my time reading all lengthy arguing over "what is a problem"? at the talk page.) Not nothing happened, and people who later come to vote should equally have a chance to acknowledge the case as well. Until I see a clean explanation presented, my position is at here. --Contrary to numerous supporters, I think the candidate's response to what Deskana raised was terrible. I invite supporters to explain what they found so positive about his response to the situation, because I'm not seeing it.'''Oppose''' The IP edits would make it hard for me  to trust this editor with the tools. <strong>'''Neutral''' I had been thinking I would have to oppose based on the IP edits.

Still, I have been hesitant to oppose on the basis of the candidate's other contributions and my observations of him and on the trust he has inspired in some other editors whose judgment I generally find to be very sound. I have been swayed from that opposition by the comments of [[User:Xymmax]] in reaffirmation. I agree with almost everything said there, except "I wouldn't have opposed over these edits in the first instance when weighed against his full body of work."—I wouldn't either, if they had not been done logged out, and so recently.

Best, --'''Support''' per Varytalk and others who made the same point. --'''Support''' I've never taken an interest in such things before.  Three things motivated me.  One: I saw on Everyking's talk page this was going on.  He reverted some of my edits based on my failure to provide adequate sourcing.  I was a bit miffed, as I was in the process of editing, but Everyking was polite, factual, and not prejudicial in his actions or response.  He defused conflict before it even began by his general tenor and a clear expression -- in words and action -- that he was motivated by the desire to create verifiable and evenhanded articles.   Two: the contentious nature of this page.  Despite the constant protestations by Wikipedia that Administrationship is a technical matter, there is a general impression that the "community" (i.e. users who focus their involvement on the administrative aspects of Wikipedia) is nominating someone for sainthood.  This seems one more dysfunctional aspect of the sprawling non-writing or researching side of Wikipedia.  This is a community I generally avoid.  Three: Everyking writes and researches articles, articles that I find valuable, and on topics (contemporary African politics) which I have repeatedly noted as crucial to the relevancy on this encyclopedia.  Articles, that if they were not here, would cause people who visit  Wikipedia to dismiss the project as a collection of white North American middle class centered minutiae.  In short this guy is building Wikipedia: something surprisingly rare amongst the chattering classes which clog this place.  That he does it in a calm, evenhanded, and immensely productive fashion would suggest to me he should be given as many tools as possible.'''Conditional support''' I'm hoping he sticks to his word and doesn't try closing AfDs/interpreting consensus. (Moved from oppose) Oh, and let me just say what Ottava's doing is pretty pathetic.Support. I don't agree with the answer to question 5 but, since I haven't cornered the market on right and wrong, am happy enough to see another view that gets tossed into the wikipedia mix.

This should be easy. --'''Support''' You've converted me from an oppose to an abso f---ing lutely support for getting through this drama and generally being cool about it.Long ago and far away I opined that the deadminning was fair enough, but was a long time ago.

That being said, I don't find many of the opposes compelling.  Most of the stuff that people are pointing to are over 3 years old.  If the issues were ongoing/current, then they would consitute an obvious oppose, but 3+ years old?  There are then allegations about "hate speech" and comments about the Catholic Church.  Unfortunately, without references, it is impossible to validate the merits of that criticism.  Unfortunately, while I generally respect Ottava, when he gets going on a crusade, I find that his objectivity tends to go out the window---which makes it impossible for me to accept his assessment of the conflict.  The fact that people are not citing more recent problems is  an indicator that issues are not ongoing.  Raul's criticism is extremely concerning, but it is still old.  Yes, Q5 is of some concern, but he says that he never closed and AFD and doesn't intend to.  While I might not accept this from a candidate with no admin history, the fact that he didn't close AfD's while an admin and hasn't since shows a lack of desire to do so.  He also indicated that this view of consensus is not to be applied to all of wikipedia.---''''''Support'''; have opposed in the past, but has done enough to earn the trust of the community.Answer to question 5 is... simply incorrect, and I could not trust you to close an AFD with that outlook. ''''''Oppose''' - Regretfully.  I cannot support any candidate who claims to be open to recall.  Recall pledges are made <i>ad captandum vulgus</i> and can be retracted or ignored post-RFA.'''Oppose''' There has been enough drama. WP is supposed to be an encyclopedia where we all can contribute. For that, we don't all need to be administrators, particularly not those who have been a focus for issues in the past. Adminship is not an award, and not having it is not a punishment.'''Oppose''' Even (for the moment) setting aside past poor judgements, incivility, and constant drama, the questions here (particularly Q5) show me an editor far, far out-of-step with current community standards and expectations.'''Oppose''' Sorry to react to content on an external site (Wikipedia Review), but the candidate's posts there give the impression of a temperament I wouldn't want in an admin.'''Oppose'''.

If Everyking feels that numbers decide the outcome of that specfic process, then I can't trust him with the tools. — ''''''''Neutral''' I have read this entire page. I was wondering if Everyking was a young person who might have made some mistakes on Wikipedia in his early days but perhaps grew up since then. As a Catholic who works on Catholic pages and has endured my share of dealing with negative opinions and anti-Catholic POV's from editors whose hatred for the Church is evident, I can sympathize with Ottava Rima's position. I certainly don't need another admin with a chip on his shoulder for the Church! Raul654 has also provided some very condemning evidence to rout this candidate's chances of adminship. It would be easier to support if I knew there would be some kind of review of this persons adminship at a later date to ensure that he does not embark on negative activities and abuse his power. I have often felt that many admins abuse their power making it hard for article creators like me to function. Lately, I have met some decent admins so I can't say they are all bad but there are certainly MANY admins whose powers should be revoked immediately. If Wikipedia wants decent articles on subjects that Readers want to see, like controversial subjects, it needs a review process for existing admins to weed out those who use their power to harrass legitimate editors just trying to put referenced facts on a page. They also need to weed out those admins who do nothing to help a legitimate editor when it is clear they are being harrassed by someone who should be blocked.Need a few thousand more edits. Also, as a friendly note and with all due respect, you might want to review the definition of "[[compromise]]".None of the things you want to do require being an admin.

I "know" Giants27 from DYK, where he is hard-working and sensible. It's the September incident at CfD makes me hesitate to !vote "support". On the one hand, Giants27 deserves credit for remembering and owning up to those incidents in which he behaved badly -- that's a sign of maturity and self-awareness, which are valuable attributes for an administrator to have. On the other hand, that lapse in judgment at CfD happened just 2-1/2 months ago... --You've been here a very long time, but your level of activity is such that I wonder if you have the width as opposed to length of experience to be an admin yet. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jesus&diff=prev&oldid=98477408 For example ] I only had to go back a hundred or so of your edits to find  you correctly reverting recent vandalism, but leaving the vandal unwarned. Your talk page doesn't show sufficient interaction with other editors for me to judge whether you are ready for admin yet. However your ability to operate in one of our most contentious areas without ever being blocked is commendable. So I'm neutral leaning to oppose at present, though I will watchlist this and may shift as the discussion proceeds, for example I'd be much more comfortable if you also had experience on say commons. ''''''Support''' You seem to be knowning what you're doing. With the edit counters being down, I trust that you have been doing what is asked. You've also been fairly active, which is helpful for this. Good luck with the RFA.'''Support''', I feel that I can honestly trust Gordonrox with the tools: I strongly believe they will not abuse the tools, Gordonrox always seems kind to users (e.g. [[User_talk:Thesavagenorwegian#Help.21|Thesavagenorwegian]]), and shows civility on their talk page, even when other users are correcting his mistakes (e.g. [[User_talk:Gordonrox24/Archive_3#Altered_Speedy_Deletion_rationale:_The_galkin_venue|altered speedy]], and on this page :D). I also believe they will use the tools to help clean-up the 'pedia (they seem pretty savvy with [[WP:CSD|CSD]], and I recall having seen articles tagged by them. And most of their reports to [[WP:AIV|AIV]] seem sensible, although I think Gordonrox should bear in mind that AIV is for users who are vandalising persistently ''at the time'' they are reported), and help other users to help clean-up the 'pedia :D (something their civility, and interaction with other users shows they are capable of). I'm also encouraged by the fact that Gordonrox has both [[WP:autoreviewer|autoreviewer]] ''and'' [[WP:ROLLBACK|rollbacker]] rights, has never been blocked, and takes part in many discussions (e.g. RfA and [[WP:AfD|AfD]])<br /> All that said, there are some faults, nothing major enough to lead me to oppose, but that I feel Gordonrox should aim to do the following; Cut down on automated editing; there's ''nothing at all'' wrong with it, I just believe that if you do, you will find yourself becoming much more involved in community processes (I'm finding this for myself anyhow). Become more involved in AIV if you plan to work there; watch what happens to your reports (e.g. how long user's are blocked for, when they aren't blocked, and what actions (if any) are taken instead of blocking). <s>Sort out your archives; the last two (archive 4 and 3) are named "archive 3" and "archive3"</s>. Get more experience; something which is going to happen no matter what =D.<br /> Overall, I think Gordonrox is ready for the tools. Unfortunately, it looks like the community is going the other way. But bear in mind that most of the opposes are concerns over lack of experience, and the so called "drama" at tedder's RfA. Both of these will fade with time, and so if you come to RfA again (should this one fail) it will likely be a much more pleasant experience. To sum up Gordonrox; a helpful user, with some minor flaws (just like all of us), who I think would greatly help the 'pedia with the tools. Best -'''Oppose''' [[File:Symbol oppose vote.svg|15px]] An admin will encounter many situations that will require a broad base of experience and knowledge. This user has not sufficently demonstrated that s/he has that. A vandal fighter alone will have to deal with some nasty and unruly users; how do we know that the canidate can handle them in the correct way? --based on the little bit of reading of diffs presented I can say that I will probably '''never''' support and always give a '''strong oppose'''.  I try and imagine how I'd react if candidate ever needed to communicate with me.  It's not a fun imagining.'''Weak Oppose''' My opposition is related to your lack of edits; you only have 4k of which quite a few are automated(though Huggle does require that you be there for the edit).

You've only been truly active for about three months, and Wisdom89 brings up a good point, as well. &ndash;'''Oppose''' - Not enough experience.  Also, I took at look at some of the editor's contributions. [[Sexually-induced sneezing]] is the article which is listed as the one with the third most of his edits, and he's the editor with the most edits to it.  The article was pretty much a mess, quite sloppy, with stuff that could easily have been fixed.  I know it's not a widely-held precept, but I believe admins should be, first of all, good editors, and I'm not seeing that here. <b><i>'''Oppose''' Just so it doesn't look like this is all about the wikibreak, I would like to say that even if this RfA were taking place in late 2007 I would have to be really skeptical.  You only have 500 mainspace edits, spread out over only 4 months.  That is really much too little for me to be able to make any kind of judgment based on what I think you'd be like as an administrator.  So basically, I agree with Rjanag. Also, I know you want this to stay open for 7 days, but I doubt that much else is going to happen from here on.  If you are interested in getting more constructive criticism I would recommend coming back to full time editing for a few months so that people will have an idea of where your strengths and weaknesses lie. -- ''<B>'''Oppose''' <s>per lack of</s> not enough [[WP:DGAF]].

''''''Oppose''' on the ground of trying to become an [[WP:SPI]] clerk to win votes.You have a clean block log and I like the way you answered my question and others. Also I'm not overly concerned about the long gap; partly because the way we currently run things someone who passed RFA three years ago and then went on wikibreak could come back now with out even a refresher course, whilst you have at least promised to proceed with caution. Also in  part because while the users change I don't see things like blocking changing that much. However I'm not sure that you were quite ready for adminship before your Wiki break, your comments re [[Meatball:DefendEachOther]] on your admin coaching page in my view indicate a lack of experience of conflict. Whilst the now deleted August 2007 [[User:GrooveDog/CQCQ]] about conquering other people's user pages is a tad myspacey and is less than 2 months ago in your wikitime. I do think you are on the right path, and if you come back in three months with a bit more experience I hope to be able to support you then. '''''Neutral''' I don't want to do a pile-on oppose, but I can't support you either.

Get a little more involved with other things as well. Don't cling to just one topic. Try to branch out and be [[WP:BOLD|creative]].

I do have to wonder if you have edited before you registered your account in May 2007.  I'm perplexed by the fact that of your first 40 edits, not one of them is a substantive article edit (one is a removal of deletion template, and two are to a template transcluded in articles).  In that time, you asked for help on the help desk and looked for experienced folks to "adopt" you.  I guess that's okay, but it kind of looks weird that you would not just start editing articles sometime in your first four days here.  The concern raised above that you don't have enough article edits in general is consistent with this issue. <br>Another issue for me is that you don't have good communications skills in English.  Either you are young (probably, given your interest in video games) or you speak English as a second language.  The "age and adminship" debate (I just noticed it while sorting through archives yesterday) need not be rehashed here, but I can see that your writing does not show me the level of maturity I normally expect to see on a viable request.  I won't say "come back in a few months", not to be mean, but I don't know if you can improve your language skills in a few months for general admin tasks - maybe for specific things like vandal-blocking that don't require you to know English all that well.'''Oppose''' Answers to all questions (Q1, Q2 and Q3) are insufficient. — <small><b><span style="border:1px solid #20406F;padding:1px 3px;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">'''Slightly Weak Oppose'''.

He seems to be a trustworthy, solid person. I'd advise him to be careful with rapid A1-type tagging (I'm sure he's already received such feedback at this point ;)), but still am willing to support him given his general good, [[WP:COMMON|common sense]]-driven demeanor.'''Support''' It seems to me that he would use the tools of an Admin wisley.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by'''Oppose''' per answers to questions 7 and 9. Candidate makes serious, elementary mistakes in interpreting A7 and A9, which are not, as his answers would have it, about "notability," but relate to "significance," clearly and explicitly described as "a lower standard than notablity." As other !voters have pointed out, related aspects of the candidate's speedy tagging have been problematic. And the answer to Q7 raises more problems than it resolves: while the article as then written had several other claims to significance that the candidate ignored, settling on the subject's winning a zero-visibility, buy-your-nomination "award" as a sign of actual notability, is quite wrong.  The candidate also missed the fact that the article was a pretty clear copyvio [http://bottomofthesky.com/About_the_Author.html], something that should be checked for when an article is so clearly promotional.'''Oppose''' - Per time and CSD.  Good luck next time. -'''Very Strong Oppose''' user has failed to do basic legwork before commenting on a community banned user, and complete lack of understanding of [[WP:SOCK]] and [[WP:BAN]].

Also, as someone who has taken articles to GA, I can't help be find it mildly aggrieving that the candidate claims GAs without giving clear credit to other involved editors. --'''Oppose''' per R<sup>2</sup> and Spartacus. Also, from nought to admin in 6 months is a bit too fast to my liking. You claim "I've demonstrated a clear knowledge of Wikipedia policies" but I'm afraid I don't agree with you (yet).'''Oppose''', would normally be inclined to Support, but the issues with CSD tagging above are too serious to ignore.  I don't expect a 100% success rate, but far too many of this user's recent tagging have been poorly done.

Suggest the candidate thoroughly review the existing speedy criteria, and if taggings improve, I would be delighted to support in the future.'''Support''' Looks great. Since working with copyright is not required or essential to most of an admin's tools or the candidate's proposed role, previous problems with copyright policy carry no weight with me. <strong>I'm concerned about the images you have uploaded and their licensing status.

Hopefully by RfA #3 Imperator will have a good understanding of our copyright policy, and a better understanding of policy in general.

Let's pretend what I don't actually imagine for a moment: that when she wrote that response she really thought that "Hangon" was an amulet against deletion of libel, copyvio, kiddy "grooming" or whatever. She'd therefore leave such material undeleted, thereby (a) doing no worse than what she does now as a non-admin, and (b) doing nothing to prevent its deletion by any of the other hundreds (thousands?) of admins. No problem there. ''Second terrible answer:'' she thought that there were "not many" circumstances in which "a non-free photograph of a living person [could] be used on Wikipedia".

All my encounters with this user have been positive and lead me to believe he will use the tools wisely.'''Oppose''' Sorry, but [[User:Tom Butler#A perfict quote|this]] kind of comment sets off alarm bells. I have very little knowledge on any of these kinds of topics. However, if a topic has been considered notable enough for Wikipedia, then all significant viewpoints on that topic must be considered and editors who consider any of those points must be extended "good faith", and  cannot be considered candidates for blocks or bans because they consider and perhaps add those points. Having an admin with such an opinion and the tools to enforce that opinion is highly problematic in my opinion('''Strong Oppose''' Kww has made it clear that he considers a person with an alternative point of view to be a charlatan or an idiot.

Both his answers to the questions and his behaviour since RfA2 lead me to conclude that he understands consensus and the proper role of admins in implementing it.  Also, while DGG raises some valid concerns about how best to proceed in AfD, I don't think that he call for a broad recusal is either wise nor necessary.  Kww will close AfD's (when he does so) in line with his reading of consensus not his own personal beliefs, just as DGG does.  (I likewise view DGG's self-imposed recusal as unnecessary and overly limiting.)  One should avoid closing AfD's in an area where one has advocated an opinion that is the equivalent of a vote on the AfD, but general opinions (even if strenuously advocated do not create a COI or a reasonable appearance of one.'''Support''' – I have to chuckle, we currently have 5 RFA’s ongoing.  2 are definite shoo-ins, two are definitely not going to succeed and [[USER:Kww|Kww]] that is borderline.  Interesting to note that the two shoo-ins have a grand total of just over 10,000 edits combined (one at just over 6,000 and one at slightly over 4,000), while the candidates in each of the failing candidacies individually surpasses the grand total of the passing individuals combined.  We look to [[User:Kww|Kww]] contributions that exceed 31, 000 edits (3 times the amount of contributions of the combined 2 other successful candidates) and we pick out this edit in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&diff=229241602&oldid=229236116|Aug ,2008]] or this edit [[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Cold_fusion/Workshop&diff=255836518&oldid=255822025|Dec 2008]] (both over a year ago)  and hold them up as examples of his intolerance.  My question is did any of the opposes read Kww statements and the circumstances they were delivered in?  “…we have editors that want to treat haunted microphones and useless nostrums as being legitimate” or  “…"Suffering fools gladly" is an important skill, and one that I agree that SA is deficient in.”.  Where I ask is the intolerance.  In fact we have all run across similar situations, or should I say only, editors that have contributed over 10,000 edits have come across those situations?  Yes are the remarks a little biting, yes, so? Sometimes the truth hurts.  Does that mean we should not speak the truth now?  Because it may hurt someone’s feelings.  I didn’t realize that [[Wikipedia]] was now a social network site where we all sit around the campfire and sing.  I have always believed we were building an encyclopedia.

Anyway, he's more than competent and the current situation where you're better having less than 10k edits when running for adminship because after that you're going to make too many enemies is far more likely to lead to poor decisions by admins than handing the mop out here.

That's not the way things work here though, everything works by consensus, and to not correctly understand policy or have the common sense to know that you don't block someone to force them to say they won't do something again, just isn't acceptable as an admin. We only block if the actual offense was bad enough to warrant it, and if we fear they'll do it again; the instance linked in Jack's oppose is a pretty straightforward mistake by someone who doesn't quite understand what's what on the english version of Wikipedia, Kww seemed in favor of blocking without giving Meursault2004 enough time to say that he wouldn't commit the act again.

I also looked at your last 50 edits to talk pages and I didn't see any meaningful discussion with other users.  Based on these I cannot support you, but I urge you to try again in six months.  Maybe try reading [[WP:ARL]]. <font  face="georgia">'''Per above - lack of command of English would cause problems - "try to warn the vandals about their ''crimes''". Crimes?

Yes BLPs should be notable, but that applies to every article, and your personal opinion of whether or not the article is notable, should not interfere with your reading the consensus at the AFD. Also the other opposes bring up some very valid reasons why you shouldn't have the bit quite yet. The vast majority of your edits are to user talk, which I find quite odd.

Also admins administer in accordance with policy, and I'm not sure you've got all the detail of that (BTW have a look at the template warnings, particularly the level 1 and level 2 ones, IMHO they are written gently and in my experience they do deter some vandals). But I'm sticking in neutral because you have made major contributions, you are an asset here and while you may not have some of the policies off pat I think you have the right attitude - lastly I don't think you'd mess up as an admin so I can't oppose. ''''''Oppose''' Judging from your talk page, no one really seems to like you. I don't see a single friendly post on there (with the exception of a "you've been granted rollback" notice and my "merry christmas" template). To add to that, you've responded to all of them with some mean, demanding comment like "Don't do it again" or just "No." You also seem to have gotten into numerous incidents with [[User:Ryulong|Ryulong]]. I find no bright side to making you an admin. <font face="terminal">'''Oppose''' Pretty much word-for-word what flaminglawyer says above.  Too many disputes; we don't need more admins seeking or creating drama than we already have.'''Ummm... no'''  Not now, and probably not for at least six months.  An admin candidate's experience in creating content is more important than in fighting vandalism, and a cursory inspection shows serious deficits in that area.'''Oppose''' Not completely happy with the very recent interaction with Ryulong, coupled with the lack of serious content contributions.

In both cases MZMcBride seems to take no consensus as an invitation to impose his own opinion over the opinion (or no agreement) of the community.

Another situation where spending time in the trenches beforehand would be beneficial.  Also, although having an opionion is good, as an admin there are core policies and procedures to be followed and not downtrodden.

''''''Neutral''' I have no problems with your userpage positions, however extreme; in fact I agree with several of them.  None of these positions ''should'' impact your functioning as an administrator, as admins should leave their personal prejudices behind when judging consensus and policy, but I just don't feel that you have enough experience here for me to say with confidence that you will be unbiased in your actions.  Come back after six more months of active editing and a spotless record and I'll be proud to support you. ''''''Neutral''' - I am torn here.  User:Nosleep technically meets most of [[User:Bearian/Standards#WP:RFA_standards|my standards]], in particular - lots of edits including [[bicycle]] articles, AfD work, and [[WP:BARN|Barnstars]].  Also, I'd like to have more diversity of LGBT folk as admins.  However, per above discussion, diffs, and statements, I am not sure about her judgment to make blocks, protection, deletions, etc.  On the whole, I would not oppose for just that - as everyone here knows, I've learned a lot "on the job."

Sure, I've argued with him before, and I'll probably do it again, but he's got good points, and in my opinion <small>which stems in part from my admin experience on Wiktionary</small> excellent judgement. --'''Support''' Well informed of the role, isn't going to be intimidated by anyone.

I admit to having had less direct contact with Ottava than some of you seem to have had, but in all the contacts I have had with him he has always struck me as having the best interests of the project at heart, and I have no reason to think that will change upon becoming an admin. Also, given his statements, it's hard to see that he'll do anything wrong with the tools.Though I usually agree with him on most things, I have to disagree with Wizardman. I think that our best content contributors make the best admins-they have experience with writing and research. These are two elements I find essential to a successful adminship.

I have the utmost respect for Ottava's mainspace contributions and his committment to making the encyclopedia a better place.  I think he is an excellent editor, but I do not believe he would make an excellent administrator on this wikipedia.  I've seen Ottava do wonderful work in encouraging resolutions to disputes, especially when they involve new editors.  I've also seen Ottava escalate other disputes (in my opinion, unnecessarily).  Sometimes he takes criticism of his and/or differences of opinion very well; sometimes he does not, and a relatively minor issue can get blown into a larger drama-fest that pulls in other editors.  I think Ottava has come a long way in his general attitude in the last year, but I think he has a little way to go before I could support him as an administrator.'''Oppose''' Too many admins currently. Just kidding. But I do agree strongly with [[User:bibliomaniac15|bibliomaniac15]]. ~ '''<font size="2">'''Oppose''' - I find Ottava well-intentioned and a good mainspace contributor, but inconsistent and unpredictable in his behaviour in project space.

I'm sorry- a history of inconsistent and tempermental behaviour prevents me from supporting.I stopped reading at "I would use the tools as leverage to discuss unblocks with other admin."

He has clue but uses it too well or too badly, I can't really tell. <small><span style="border:1px solid #339933;padding:1px;">I have to side with Majorly on "he knew how this would go". Ottava is clueful in many respects but every now and then the cluefulness disappears and transforms into some seemingly random erratic judgement. For instance, Ottava is notably tough in RfAs. He opposes a lot of candidates and although I disagreed in many cases, I've been surprised to see him support candidates that fail the very standards he has set elsewhere. As another example, I can't for the life of me understand how someone with usually sound judgement writes [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=264549898 this response] to a victim of real-life stalking.Sorry, but I don't feel comfortable trusting you with the mop since you were, quite literally, just denied rollback. --'''[[WP:NOTNOW]]. Nowhere near enough experience to demonstrate a thorough and intricate understanding of Wikipedia policies, which are vast and bureaucratic and complicated, or demonstrate ability to handle disputes / judge consensus / etc. "Any Administrative work would suit me" does not suggest a good understanding of what adminship involves, or that you actually need the tools.

I've seen Polargeo at AfD and MfD before, and my general impression is that he's intelligent, articulate, and reasonable. His content work is truly excellent; he has improved Wikipedia's coverage of glaciology and Antarctica considerably. I'm impressed with his GA, [[Pine Island Glacier]], which is well-written and informative, and I look forward to even more great contributions from Polargeo. My survey of his work at AfD also makes me confident that he has a pretty good grasp of policy and the ability to articulate well-reasoned arguments. Like Gigs, I see Polargeo as someone who has strong opinions and isn't afraid to express them and argue for them &ndash; not a negative in an admin at all. But in spite of all of the above, there are things that make me hesitate to support this RfA. First, the relatively small breadth of Polargeo's CSD-tagging experience makes me wonder whether he's ready to be an admin working speedy-deletion. I trust his judgement, but I'd like some evidence to back that up. Second, Polargeo has a tendency to get involved in debates over heated subjects &ndash; including Balkans-related deletion discussions such as [[WP:Articles for deletion/Mass rape in the Bosnian War|1]] [[WP:Miscellany for deletion/User:UBX/User Republika Srpska|2]] [[WP:Miscellany for deletion/User:Makedonij|3]] [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Aradic-es/Future aticles/UK during destruction of Yugoslavia|4]]. He argues very passionately, which is not necessarily a negative in an admin. But would he misuse the tools in a dispute in such a contentious area? I trust that he wouldn't, but I would rather see him stay cooler and more collected than he did at [[WP:Articles for deletion/Mass rape in the Bosnian War]]. Finally, Polargeo [[Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts/archive75#Polargeo and Atmoz|was reported]] one month ago to [[WP:WQA]] for behavior that an uninvolved user described as "basically ganging up to insult [a] user as though he was an SPA troll." Because of Polargeo's clean block log, I probably wouldn't care if the WQA was 3+ months ago &ndash; but it was just one month ago. For those reasons, and because I'm not entirely satisfied with the answers to the questions, I've decided to oppose. Polargeo will make a fine administrator one day, but not just yet.'''Oppose''' due to the concerns presented above. <small><span style="border:1px solid #000000;padding:1px;">'''Oppose''' for this most recent edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_scientists_opposing_the_mainstream_scientific_assessment_of_global_warming&diff=prev&oldid=333540337] Getting involved in such a controversial cesspool shows poor judgment.  And I view RFAs as ''prima facie'' evidence of epic fail.I remain neutral on this one. The candidate does show knowledge of policies and dispute resolution.

If people don't see that it's difficult to determine that your judgment has been demonstrated. Also, I personally feel that empathy should be a requirement for an administrator and that empathy comes from making similar contributions and facing similar challenges and setbacks of other editors.

[[Sailing and Fighting Instructions]] has too many redlinks (see [[WP:Redlink]] for advice), [[Sioux Falls Public Transit]] is a brand new article, so I wouldn't expect it to be much, but I would think at least a stub template would be nice.

Evidence of article building would also help.'''Oppose'''. I don't have a problem with the short timespan of editing, and the relatively small number of mainspace edits aren't a deal breaker. But looking at the last 500, most of them are with Huggle. I don't have a problem with hugglers, but I don't feel like I get an idea of ''this'' editor's contribution style when there's so little. Same for user talk edits -- almost all of them are with huggle, so I get very little feel for the communication style. Add to that recent AfD contributions that show a lack of understanding of AfD arguments ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Portland_Fiction_Project&diff=prev&oldid=286971719] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Emo_Apocalypse&diff=prev&oldid=286971905] are two of the three random recent AfDs I looked at), and I don't feel this candidate is ready yet.

He has an amazing sense of perspective as to what's wrong, what needs to be improved, and what to do. I think it's a damn shame that he landed in the wrong side of no-man's-land so early into his editing career. It's easy to think that it's preposterous that a guy who skirted the boundaries of a community ban is up to no good, but appearances can be deceiving. ''''''''Support''' - Though outspoken, I fully trust Roux. He's helped me get into Wikipedia, and I trust him with the tools.

You'll make a great and wise sysop, brother. Godspeed --Sorry, no.

Steve's was considerably below par.'''Oppose''' - I'm sorry, but I have to. I can trust you in some sense and think that you'd be decent. However, I, at the same time, cannot feel that you can be trusted in general. It would have been better for Petter if he had told people to begin with about the incident, but he was mostly a victim. You, however, should never have been followed through with the temptation. Adam and Eve were stripped of Eden for trying to steal divine knowledge. You are merely kept from few buttons for stealing them. There is a right way, and a wrong way. You chose the wrong way and we have enough people who haven't and still do not get access to them. I also remember that your response to being blocked was constant complaining about it as if you didn't deserve to be blocked. I have no confidence that you ever thought that what you did was wrong, when it was one of the worst kinds of wrongs you could do.Reluctantly.  I'm torn here, but I'm surprising myself by opposing instead of abstaining.  I believe in second chances, and I don't question your dedication.  But I'm really disappointed in A4.  You've had a year to think about what happened back then, and come up with a description/explanation. But A4 is really poorly explained, contains what I consider to be a fair amount of spin, and seems to dwell on (paraphrasing) "costs outweigh the benefits", when the ''correct'' answer, IMHO, is "there were absolutely no benefits".  I don't care too much about one IP edit during the ban, if that's all there was.  I don't understand all the subtle complexities involved in the Simple English thing, and your intentions may have been innocent, but it does add to my unsettled feeling that adminship now would be too soon, and probably is what nudged me from abstain to oppose. Luckily, you've said in many places that you don't really care if this succeeds or not, so I don't have to feel guilty hurting your feelings. --I don't know for which devil I'm playing the advocate here, but Steve Crossin ''did'' get a second chance--there was an end to the ban, and he has regained all the rights and privileges of editorship. "Forgiveness" for past wrongs doesn't mean the same as "giving more privileges which could potentially be abused"--I hope the modifier and the modal indicate that I don't expect Steve Crossin to abuse those tools, should this pass. For now, I also am torn, between the sentiments expressed in the third support vote and the strict but, in my opinion, fair statements by Roux.

There's a disturbing attitude taken towards some of his work here that isn't right for an admin to have. '''Kudos for the correct use of "comprises". Although I can't support currently (based on answers to several of the questions, seemingly (over)use of IRC, and the appearance of dramaproneness, i.e. the withdrawal and subsequent relisting of this request), I hope you continue your work at the sockpuppet board and elsewhere. Mahalo. --'''Oppose''' - Two reasons. First, your answer to question 6 from GlassCobra is an exercise in obfuscation; either you have an established procedure for honoring requests for withdrawal or reconfirmation of your admin privileges--which you would openly advertise on your user page and pledge to enforce without delay if certain ironclad criteria are met--or you do not intend to honor such requests. Your "non-denial denial" gave me serious pause.<br /> Secondly, your response to question 9 from Skomorokh also set off my BS-meter. His question was straight-forward; you have, in fact, failed three previous RFAs across two usernames, the last of which prompted you to withdraw early and pen an essay extolling the virtues of deferring adminship in favor of fully dedicating one's self to editing. You appeared to have had an epiphany...but then spent most of your time between your last RFA and now building up admin career capital by acting as an unflagged helper in various high-visibility areas in Project space. You made extra sure to shake lots of hands, cultivate support on IRC and avoid controversy. In short, you learned how to sail through an RFA. This is a major change from your previously consistent attitude, and more than enough to make me wonder. In admins, I value transparency, blunt honesty, and above all, a healthy degree of zen-like selflessness manifested through the ability to function without constant praise or attention. Your less-than-fully-honest responses, when coupled with your prior actions as outlined above, give me cause to believe that you would be an unsuitable admin at this time.'''Neutral''' - Synergy, you've many positive edits to WP, so I'm not going to oppose. I can't support because of something Jenna pointed out above - "He managed 41 supports in less than 12 hours, which seems impressive, but many of the names are those I recognize from IRC ...".The reason why Tango was desysopped was not simply because of his bad block of MONGO. Yes, it was excessively lengthy, coupled with the fact that he'd already campaigned against MONGO, making him involved - even disregarding these facts, the block occured several hours after MONGO's mildly uncivil comment (which he made in frustration), which makes it punitive regardless of context. And there was a good deal of context in the case of Tango - he's made a number of very bad judgment calls using the tools (not a huge amount, but enough to be a concern). Yet if Tango believes that his block of MONGO was the reason he lossed adminship, he has missed the point. It was not solely because of that one very bad block, not even considering other very bad calls prior to that - it was because, when Tango opened his actions for review, he would respond to any negative comment with excessive defensiveness and try to justify his actions further, creating a great deal more frustration than what it should have been. That's why Tango was desysopped - ''he refuses to accept criticism when given''. Tango's refusal to acknowledge his block of MONGO as a bad call was (and remains) a serious concern, and given the background of making very bad calls and not learning from them, the odds of him making yet another very bad call were high enough that it warranted revoking his tools to prevent it from happening again. If Tango were to have admitted in his nomination statement, "you know, I screwed up, I'll avoid using the tools like that again," and he'd demonstrated that he learned how to control his emotions when he's being criticized, then I'd support. But after reading his nomination statement (particularly openly stating that he will not recuse from administrative action against MONGO) and looking at the way he's responding to the opposes, I am convinced that Tango is unsuited for adminship. And I feel really bad about it, because I like Tango and I think he is a great editor, but not every editor is meant to be an administrator.'''Strong oppose''' - Absolutely not, based on the concerns of nearly everybody above me.

Are you running into problems editing in your desired areas and being prevented from accomplishing your goals because of a lack of admin tools? If so, it might be a good idea to outline those situations. If not, you might do best just to continue "as you were" and not take on the extra headaches that come with being an admin.

I would rather he assist the developement of an article rather than jump to delete. ''It is simply more demanding to create content, than it is to delete it.'' from above Editor:Power Corrupts....--'''Oppose''' - Thumperward has most impressive technical skills, but lacks the interpersonal skills that I think are necessary for a position of trust in the community. --'''Oppose''' - This editor surely has made many contributions to WP. However, his track record of conflicts is extremely troublesome. I have not been able to observed him actually creating real content in the struggle to improve an article, indeed in his answers above, he could only state one article with significant contribution of content. He seems to usually just swoop into sight with reverts or deletes without having been involved in an ongoing development of a topic. This has led to creating obstacles and additional work for other editors. Contrary to his statements in this application I have not observed him following his stated 'rule' of 'forced discussions'. I came to the impression that some reverts by this editor are retaliatory in nature. Therefore I have been reluctant to enter my opinion here, because of the prospect of further such actions. In my opinion this editor would use his stated interest in locking articles after he applied his desired changes. His deletionist attitude is extremely worrisome, especially since he appears to actively and aggressively pursue deletions instead of finding ways to salvage and improve. As an administrator he should be able to abstain from active pursuit or voicing opinions about such actions, rather act in the sole role of executing editor consensus. An administrator should rank below editors in status, and should perform the elevated powers with expert efficiency and skill at the discretion of editors. While he has the skill and knowledge, an administrator however should be a support and service person to editors, not a superior or dictator. In this regard, it appears the candidate is not a proper match for the position. The candidate had a previous failed request for adminship. While the nomination text above states that the candidate has learned from experience, the reality of his track record and the reflection thereof in this poll do not bear this out. The nature of complaints against the candidate are much of the same nature and the numerical level of opposition is much the same if not higher. Since the candidate presumably knew of his future desire for adminship, he should have exercised extreme care not to raise any concerns or controversies over his record in the time since his first request, yet he obviously hasn't done so. From this fact, one cannot expect that he will exercise restraint once bestowed adminship.'''Oppose''' Overall I'm concerened enough by a number of the opposers comments above that at this time I have to oppose.--'''[[WP:NOTNOW]]''' - With under 150 edits in two years, we don't have any way to judge how you'd behave as an admin.

Looked over approx. 100 recent reversions and only found one mistake[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ziploc&diff=prev&oldid=289994523]; 1% mistake rate probably doesn't translate to potential sloppiness when blocking (alleged) vandals. Currently neutral solely due to answer to Q6: one should at least do a cursory search for references before AfD nomming an article for lack of references. Not a big deal, but it concerns me that an admin wouldn't at least make a minor effort to see if references exist in such a situation. -'''Neutral''' I don't know. Awesome edits, but 10K with huggle?

On the other hand, it is surrounded by [[:File:Target logo.svg|big red and white circles]] which change the equation in a big way, and I don't think that a starting point of 5% is appropriate for an admin.

Trustworthy admins, regardless of activity level, are a potentially incredible resource, and present us with a net benefit.  The "all or nothing" reasoning of opposers is irrational, and is at the top of the list of [[cognitive distortion]]s from the field of [[cognitive psychology]].

He absorbed and used whatever i had to share, and went on to do far more than i could ever hope to.  He is a mature, skilled, prolific researcher and writer.  Much of this is reflected in [[List of Registered Historic Places in Los Angeles]] and linked articles.  More recently, he responded to some general calls for help addressing backlog in the DYK area -- I want to claim some credit for asking him, but he did all the work -- and he has been a solid editor there.

Too much emphasis on policing and vandal-fighting and too little on creating content. I will elaborate for those who attack such reasons. I am well aware that some think that content-writing does not matter much to understand Wikipedia. Not surprisingly, such opinion is common in the non-writing but rather chatting and socializing quarters. Arguments are well known. Moreover, a small minority of non-writing admins are actually good ones. However, the wrong judgment and especially the wrong attitude towards other editors are much more common among the admins with little interest in content creation but a greater interest in being in a position to tell others what to do, "run" wikipedia and chat-a-lot. The admins often have to make a judgment on the issues that very much affect the article writers who are mostly concerned about the content. Appreciating these concerns is very difficult without a significant involvement in the content creation. At least one must demonstrate a significant interest in the content creation even if lack of time prevents one from contributing much at the time. Answers to questions about 3RR suggests that the candidate plans to get involved in critical decisions that would affect content and ''content editors''. The "wikipedia-runners" patrolling 3RR, ANI, etc. prescribing blocks and making rulings (often above our policies) make a srong net-negative impact on the Wikipedia, which is an encyclopedia first of all rather than an internet site for other activities. --'''Nominator support''' as a nominator [[User:NHRHS2010|<span style="background:black;color:red;font:10pt cooper black">NHRHS</span>]][[User talk:NHRHS2010|<span style="background:red;color:black;font:10pt lucida sans">2010</span>]]'''Strong support'''.

This is an RfA where I'm unsure which side to go on, do I support or oppose? J.delanoy (for the sake of convenience, I'll refer to him as J) is clearly a user who is committed and self-assigned to the task of reverting ''mass'' amounts of vandalism, has the interest of Wikipedia at heart and is civil to boot. However, for an administrator we need to see the encyclopedia-aspect of candidates, and with J that is something near impossible since most of the mainspace edits are reverts of vandalism (which are mightily good I should add) and we also need to see someone who is versatile; willing and capable to venture outside of their comfort zones to make decisions which will further the encyclopedia. With answers like that of Q4, I have doubts about J's ability to do anything of the such. As Dweller mentions in the statement, it is okay to be specialised at something, but if that is something which the user is totally focused on (and it is something which is capable by every other administrator) the magnitude of that specialism is reduced.

The candidate is a vandal fighter, so he surely needs the blocking tool if he become an admin. However, well, after seeing the attack to his disputer on the AFD, I'm not sure he would not abuse the tool when he would be in dispute. The candidate's behaviors on the AFD is quite a major disappointment; teasing his disputer, quoting [[WP:Don't-give-a-fuckism]] to attack him. Well, not a good model in civility. As for the nominator's statement, I get that one of nominators' job for their candidates is to woo and glorify their candidates' assets and achievements in front of voters. However, the first lengthy paragraph just fills with a negative projection of the nominator's "own" evaluation on a user who was disputing with the candidate. That rather gave me a disturbing image to the candidate (calling one disputer a POV pusher could be equally applied to the other). After some research, the named editor is indeed a SPA with a strong agenda[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wasilla_Assembly_of_God&oldid=235896132] and "possibly" used a sock[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Tautologist]. However, RFA is all about how the candidate has behaved what thought he thinks, not about a place to present how the nominator thinks. With these reasons, I can't support the candidate.--'''Support''' Since everyone below is citing the answers as oppose rationale, my support rationale is- Excellent answer to Q6. :) But more seriously, appears to be thoughtful and sensible from a quick glance at contribs. -I'm confused about the answer to Q5, seems like more experience is needed, sorry.'''Support''' Wow.

However, I do want to see someone with a little more that 4 months experience with [[Wikipedia]] as shown here [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=Kakofonous&site=en.wikipedia.org].  If we start to use the standards that after four months; “…I trust the individual with the tools”.  Why not give the administrative tools to all editors say after three months of no complaints by other editors.  In addition, don’t we want the individuals applying for the administrative tools to have some experience in other areas?  Like administrative?  I do not see that with this candidate.  Is this reflection of the candidate’s ability or knowledge to use the extra buttons?  Of course not!  Is this a question of the individual’s competency?  Yes!  Four months is to short a time to judge the individuals character.  Sorry. <font face="Times New Roman">'''Reasonably strong support''' per ANI.

It doesnt matter, I think I've seen enough of this admin in action to judge without knowing. This is an admin who is so concerned about doing things correctly they opened a [[Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2008_January_4#True_Blue|DRV]] on themselves, just to make sure no loose end was missed. WP needs more admins as conscientious as Keilana. ++'''Support''', this user has my confidence to continue acting as an admin.'''Support''' I don't see any problem if the name change wasn't of malicious intent.

Agree that the RfA is unnecessary.'''Neutral''' I echo some of Ryan's comment but I express them as a regular community user who has no idea what Keilana's previous admin identity was. Based on Keilana's contribution, I have no reason to oppose her <s>but I also do not have enough established history to support her either.</s> There are a lot of blank pages and I suppose all the community has is to take a far extreme adaption of [[WP:AGF]] in the case of admin tools. You don't ''really'' know this person but you are going to have to trust the judgment of the crats that give the tools back. ''To my knowledge'', an RtV admin has not yet abused this system and the community has benefited from not losing these valuable contributors due to off-wiki harassment and the like. However, I admittedly do have some overarching concerns and reservation about the process itself. I wonder how obsolete and diminished in importance that WP:RfA becomes when view in hindsight of how RtV admins are handled. In theory, the RfA process is meant to be a community gauge of consensus and trust in the admins based on who they are and what they have done. Supposedly, this is an level playing field since any community member has access to view the same contribution history as anyone else. The case of RtV admins does make it less level since only a small group of people can truly see the "big picture" in order to make an informed decision of whether or not to trust this individual-something that the larger community lacks. Despite my philosophical concerns, I don't see a reason for Keilana to be "test subject" for the conflicts between RtV and RfA and would support this RfA (while made in good faith) to be closed, with Keilana maintaining her admin status, in lieu of a broader community discussion on the main issues.'''Neutral''' - I'm one to support reconf. RfAs, usually stating the opposite of whatever [[User:Neil|Neil]] says. However, this is totally ridiculous to me. I've been debating this for days, reading over everything, including Walton's series of books, and I just can't bring myself to support. I get the RTV deal, but I think if something happened that caused me to need to vanish, my ass would vanish and I wouldn't bring it up again. I find it increasingly unsettling when users RTV then advertise it later, or link to their old account. It does not make sense to me. I also fail to see a need to put a recall link in ones signature. That seems like one hoping for a recall request, which is strangely masochistic. As far as edits, some diffs provided may be slight cause for concern, but overall I think her admin edits are overwhelmingly beneficial to the project, therefore, I cannot oppose the candidate, although I do oppose this stupid process of "Retaining RfA" based on one dumbfounded request.

As the dispute resolved itself over time without administrator attention, reporting it seems to have been the wrong choice.

It is not gaming the system to read the polices one or twice before an RFA. - '''I take issue with some of the answers to the questions. "Non-notable subjects without reliable sources" is not a speedy deletion reason and many articles to which this description may apply are explicity carved out and directed to other deletion processes.

It is in these forums that each of us can declare what particular aspects of the sysop responsibility we feel are important, whether or not the candidate has demonstrated sufficient competency in those areas, and whether or not we [[User:Avraham/RfA-B|trust]] the candidate to act in an appropriate manner in situations that may require the mop-and-flamethrower™. In my opinion, Pete has demonstrated the judgment and interactions that I feel are paramount to proper application, and more importantly, non-application, of the tools that the sysop bit affords. Looking at random diffs from his 950+ user talk conversations, I find that he portrays a friendly, polite demeanor, even when in disagreement with the editor with whom he is conversing. This personality trait, that of civility in the face of opposition or worse, is one that I feel is critical to sysops to minimize, if not nearly eliminate, the chances of wikidrama, wheel wars, or worse. Pete's contributions to mainspace articles stand on their own as an indication of his understanding of both the project's ultimate purpose as well as the policies and guidelines that govern the day-to-day workings of the project. The point has been raised about the relative dearth of experience in regards to certain administrative duties. My personal opinion is that while a high level of sophistication can certainly not be claimed, enough understanding has been demonstrated to indicate that the user will not abuse the tools, will fill any knowledge gaps quickly, and will help continue the smooth working of the project. I believe there is a fundamental difference, and the project members [[Wikipedia:Requests for bureaucratship/Avraham|have clearly stated]], between the level of sophistication (at least vis-a-vis RfA's) which we require from bureaucrats, since their actions are more permanent, and sysops, each of whose actions may be corrected, if necessary, by any other admin. This safety net is sufficient enough for me to feel that the remote possibility of a mistake made from ignorance is far outweighed by the positive characteristics that Pete presents. --'''Oppose''' Per Balloonman.

I find, however, that a large portion of criticism directed at the candidate (I speak of criticism about candidate's answer to Q4, the religious statement made on the user page and the self-nomination) has nothing constructive about it and I find it just shameful at how many people have taken the opportunity to take a jab at you without telling you what it is that you could have done in order to avoid such scrutiny.

He says he didn't know that this was a procedural faux pas, and while that was almost certainly true, abstaining from closing discussions one has commented on is a huge deal in my mind, and the fact that he didn't know even that important aspect of the deletion process causes me to question the thoroughness of his policy knowledge. A similar problem was also exhibited on [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WRNY (AM)|these]] [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WRRC (FM)|two]], which were also [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 November 18|overturned at DRV]], although I can't find a relisting of them anywhere interestingly.

While it's good that he was able to understand he was wrong, if someone is going to report a user to be blocked quickly because of his username, he should be sure that his report is correct. His last RfA was also a bit over two months ago, and while waiting three months is not a steadfast rule, I appreciate when an editor can respect the community's norms; this isn't a huge deal though. Ever since being appointed to featured portal co-director, he has not given up a chance to make note of it (cf. Q2 and userpage). This seems to me as if he sees that this appointment (and therefore it is not unreasonable to assume he sees adminship this way) as a trophy. I'm also really confused about the answer to Q3 [[User:Rudget/AC#Round two|here]]. I assume that was written incorrectly; otherwise I think he may need to scale back his time here. [[User:Rudget/Contributions#Users I've helped to block|This]] is extremely distasteful, and my biggest concern. Blocking is not something we strive to do, and then wear a list of users we have gotten blocked as a badge of honor. Interestingly, at least one of those users has never been blocked before. It is these several lapses in judgment that, while none are particularly serious, (although I still cannot get over his ''Users I've helped to block'' list), that cause me enough concern about misuse (although not neccessarily ''abuse'') of the tools, as well as his attitude towards things if he were to become an admin.

I am not doing any “wrong queue” jokes today, because I want to offer my serious support on two levels. First, the candidate has done extraordinary work that is deserving of commendation – that is a given. Second, concern is being raised over the isolated comments made by the candidate that, admittedly, were not framed correctly. This should not be a cause for disqualification. People will, on occasion, say the wrong thing. But that is why the words “sorry” and “apologize” are part of the vocabulary. On a few too many RfA occasions, I’ve seen highly qualified candidates whacked because isolated incidents of poorly-considered opinions and badly-phrased comments were taken out of context and magnified inappropriately in an effort to obscure a larger body of positive work. I sincerely hope this is not going to be the case here.'''Support''', the mildly uncivil (incivil? noncivil?) comments aren't Wehwalt's finest hour but they look like isolated incidents in a long editing history, and aren't ''that'' bad in any case. Still, I'd urge Wehwalt to take the civility comments in this RfA on board. Other than that, a good content editor on controversial topics, with a good grasp of Wikipedia's core policies. Seems fine to me.Enthusastic '''Support'''. Have been impressed with what I've seen. <font color="green">Did we run out of sysop bits? Are admins really expected to be perfect? Wehwalt's positive contributions to the project are clear to see, but you have to get out a magnifying glass and squint real hard to see anything negative here.

He's got too many civility issues to use the tools in areas where he has an emotional stake in the outcome of a controversial action.  I trust that he is aware of that and I trust him to know when it's time to "just be an editor" and to let some other administrator use the sysop bit.  If it weren't for his strong editing and the general knowledge of Wiki-processes that come with his edits, this would be a neutral or oppose.'''Oppose'''. The diffs brought up by [[User:Either way|Either way]] in the neutral section are unacceptable for an administrator to have.  You will be representing Wikipedia if you gain the admin bit, and comments like the ones given there will give the encyclopedia a bad reputation.  Even if you do not plan to actively use the administrative tools, users will still come to you for advice, disputes will be brought to you for judgement, and your communicating skills will be utilized daily.  Even if you are making a reply to a vandal, your goal should be to rehabilitate them into--at the very least--a regular user that does not vandalize Wikipedia, rather than to make them into a repeat vandal.  You are a talented writer, but I do not think you have the necessary skills to become an administrator.  <font  face="georgia">'''[[User:Malinaccier|Malinaccier]]'''Oppose''' - We don't need more incivil administrators. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><b>&mdash;'''Strong Oppose'''.

Sorry, Wehwalt, I normally like to support article builders at RfA, but I regard this sort of lying and inconsistent application of rules as an automatic and absolute bar to adminship or any other position of trust. And before people jump in and say I'm just opposing because my POV is different than Wehwalt's, not so: I will support (so-called) "pro-Israel" candidates if they have demonstrated that they can be trusted, for example [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_bureaucratship/Avraham&diff=194761016&oldid=194759789 here].'''Support'''- I actually thought you were ''already'' an admin. <font face="Lucida Calligraphy" color="blue">'''Support'''.

For a succesful RfA, the candidate needs to show that he can apply policy correctly, or at least to show the ability to research policy that they are unclear with.'''Oppose''' I am not, for reasons a recitation of which I will save everyone, particularly concerned about the (putative) lack of article-writing experience, and I don't know that Addshore's involvement in project space fails to provide a sufficient record upon which to base conclusions about his knowledge of policy and practice (in fact, it appears clear to me that Addshore is relatively conversant in policy and practice, even if it is not altogether clear that he well apprehends whereof the guiding practice and policy of which he does not fully know), but I do join in the concerns about judgment and temperament raised by [[User:Shalom|Shalom]] (although not in those terms, and perhaps more couchedly), and so, notwithstanding the good deal that there is to commend Addshore to adminship and the fact that most of my (passive) interactions with him have been quite fine, I can't&mdash;at least at this time&mdash;conclude with a sufficient degree of confidence that [[User:Jahiegel/Views on Wikipedia/Requests for adminship|the net effect on the project of the candidate's being sysop(p)ed should be positive]].'''Neutral'''.

True, this user is a great patroller, and I have awarded him a barnstar in the past for his efforts, but there's more to adminship than just that.

What would help me greatly is you being able to convince me that, since blocking will likely be your area of admin work, and since blocking tends to be a very touchy area because it deals primarily with contributors not content, that you'll be fine.

Most certainly, everything I have reviewed points toward a person committed to maintaining the encyclopedia. Can this candidate be trusted <u>with</u> the mop...? I just do not get any sense that this is an editor who interacts with the community, except as a vandal fighter. I do not see any evidence of the necessary nuances or flexibility in application of (often conflicting) policies generally. Despite the impressive pure statistics I do not think the candidate has been here long enough to pick up fully the ethos of Wikipedia that a sysop is supposed to exemplify. If it wasn't for my belief that this editor is absolutely non-abusive in intent and practice I am afraid I would be opposing.Optimistic '''neutral'''. I'm having trouble finding something showing how this user would handle him/herself in a conflict.

If that is the candidate's perception of the AfD process, then I have little to no confidence in his or her knowledge of how consensus works.

I've RfA'd twice, and obviously did not so well. How smart is it to not take it so seriously? Genius in my opinion. I took it WAY too seriously. Adminship, when used, is serious to a degree, but not using it all the time like some other users might want, isn't serious either. I'd rather have an admin who doesn't use the tools at all, than one who uses them inappropriately. This user seems like the kind to use them appropriately, and sparingly which I think is perfect. some admins get upset in RfA's when the candidate declares they won't help in a specific area, or when they get the impression that they'll help in an area they think doesn't need much help. just cause they won't help in YOUR area, doesn't mean they won't be helpful. Once again, great answers, and you seem like you know what you're doing! Good luck!'''Oppose''' This isn't based on the refusal to answer optional questions, but for not showing at least a small understanding of admin related tasks and issues. Seems like a great editor, but before I'm willing to trust someone with the tools, I have to know that you can use it correctly and know how/why to use them. <font face="Ravie">'''Oppose''', because the nom makes no sense to me. If you are not going to use the tools, there's absolutely no point in nominating yourself for adminship. And yet the comment to Dank55 above makes it seem that you're interested in the tools? The contrived nomination statement only shows you're looking to draw attention to yourself and your 'controversial' ideas about adminship, and this isn't the correct forum to do that (try the talk page). -'''Oppose'''. I do love a good sense of humor. I like to think that I have one, perhaps not as visible on Wikipedia as in real life, but answering Q1 by saying you won't do any admin work at all, and answering the blocking vs. banning optional question by simply linking a policy page...well, I think requesting adminship should be a bit more serious than that.'''Strong Oppose'''. Unconvinced you'd use the tools correctly; very little experience in admin-related tasks and your use of policy links to answer questions hardly inspires support. "I don't really think I need administrator tools, and in fact would vow not to use them in all but the most grievous of circumstances." ..What is the point of giving tools to someone who is unlikely to use them? You dont have to use them constantly of course, but I find it stupid giving tools designed to help the encyclopedia to someone who admits to being unlikely to make use of them. In addition, applying to prove a point makes a mockery of the process. Yes, admins are technically no more important than users, but RfA in a way shows the quality and quantity of your contributions to Wikipedia; debasing that to prove a point is almost disruptive.'''Oppose''' - The admin tools are supposed be tools, we shouldn't give them to people who aren't going to use them.

While there are many positive constructive traits about this candidate, Asenine's RfA behavior - which I think would be a predictor of admin behavior - is bureaucratic, arrogant and often nonsensical. The questions Asenine posts - so often they are templates - in (almost?) every RfA these days are ambiguous, of dubious relevance to adminship, and in my opinion, smack of self-importance. Often the questions are asked [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Editorofthewiki&diff=prev&oldid=241513807 after] an oppose !vote has already been cast, or [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/IMatthew&diff=prev&oldid=241316949 directly before] a support !vote ("the epitome of nothing wrong here").

The result was a better-written, more tightly sourced passage which seemed to meet his objections. (At the time, I mistook Avruch for Avriham and I almost left a note on Avruch's page to say that now I'd twice had my prose edited by someone who had impressed me with the improvements. Since reading this page, I'm happy to find out what we have here is four hands on the keyboards rather than two.) I'm also impressed by Avruch having Lar as a mentor. I looked over Avruch's contributions, and I'm impressed by his cool, helpful comments in discussions. As others have said, he may show up a lot on some of our drama stages, but he's not there to ham it up (I saw a minor exception in one spot, but nobody's perfect; and, frankly, he keeps his cool much better than this non-admin does). He contributed a bit at the Mantanmoreland arb case, and I overall disagreed with what he said, but I can't question his judgment or his tone there. I didn't want to vote before seeing how he'd answer my questions above, and he answered them well, except for Question #11. What I wanted to see in that answer was whether he'd stand up even against a consensus if it went against policy. Even if there are 170 or so editors going one way, it's the closing admin's duty to go the other if that's the only way policy can be interpreted. That disappointment aside, this is clearly an editor knowledgeable about policy and procedures (from quite early on in his contributions, it seems), and one who pretty obviously has the maturity to be an admin. And thanks, Avruch, for quickly answering all those questions. I think you'll be a real asset to WP.'''Oppose''' I thought the candidate already became an admin per his/her activities in Wikipedia space. Recently at ANI, he or she promised to meditate or listen to some dispute related to me, but just went off unlike his promise.

I guess the candidate could have enough time to show up here for his election campaign but could not afford his/her time to needed problems.

So opposing to avoid bothering ArbCom in a few months time.  --'''Oppose''' Whilst Giano is rather brusque in his assessment, the underying message is one that I wholeheartedly agree with. We are here to write an encyclopedia and recently, wikidrama, which has in part been fuelled by Avruch, is detrimental to the encyclopedia. I see adminship as tools to help content creators to help build the encyclopedia. I don't believe that Avruch is suited to that added responsibility, as frankly, I don't see many substantive mainspace edits that could be enhanced with admin tools. I simply don't have the feeling that Avruch being an administrator would have a positive effect on wikipedia.'''Support''' Ben has single handedly transformed the appearance of hundreds of chemistry pages with superb graphics.  Complaints below about "low mainspace edits" and "lack of familiarity" are irrelevant when one considers how many articles carry Ben's brilliant images.  Such statistics merely reflect the technical quirk that separates image content from the word content.  Ben has been a committed Wikipedian, and a great colleague.'''Automatic support''' - I didn't give more than a cursory glance to his edits and really don't care one way or the other, but when I see people opposing for "namespace balance" reasons, I automatically support.  I don't support the notion that you need to have some exact percentage of mainspace vs Wikipedia space edits in order to have the technical competence to hit a block, delete, or protect button. --'''Support''', and I'm going to give a fairly detailed reason.  Project experience is not needed to be an admin.  Being an admin is fairly easy.  I know a lot of people like to suggest it is incredibly hard, and a massive, onerous responsibility, but honestly, it is not a difficult job for most people.  The tools are very easy to figure out and to use, and if a user is bright enough to edit in the way Benjah has done so, they will have no problems.  Adminship is only difficult for those who are unsuited to the role (ie not bright, not trustworthy, or with very little maturity). Sure, a lack of experience in certain areas may require a light touch at first, but I see no evidence to suggest that wouldn't be the case.  Would five hundred mindless "per above" RFA supports and "keep"s at AFDs change that?  Of course it wouldn't.  All that is required is evidence that the candidate is bright, sensible, and trustworthy.  I see ample evidence of all three, and foresee Benjah having no problems with the tools.'''Support''' per the principal that resulted from [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/DrKiernan]]. A good editor is a good editor, especially if they can handle chemistry. :)'''Oppose''' - [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?limit=50&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=Benjah-bmm27&namespace=4&year=&month=-1 no projects space] edits apart from wikiprojects and this RfA. Also, with the exception of page moves, the candidate could start all of the activities he mentions in Q1.'''Oppose''' Contributions history makes it too difficult to discern whether this user has a good grasp of policy.'''Oppose'''. I agree that article edits are the most important thing for an admin, but at the same time some project-space experience is also needed, and 31 edits, most of them related to this RfA, just aren't enough. There's also very little article talk compared to number of article edits. I'll definitely consider supporting next time if there's more experience in those areas. <font color="Purple">Oppose per lack of experience in dealing with other users - this relates to the talk and user talk namespaces as well as the Wikipedia space.

I feel admins need to have near perfect edit summary usage since edit summaries are a VERY important aspect of being an admin.'''Strong Oppose''' - I'd no sooner have a committed nationalist (to ANY nation) as an admin than I would a user named [[KiddyDiddler666]]. It has nothing to do with my personal views, or my offended sensibilities - it boils down to the same argument that's behind 90% of [[WP:UAA]]: Wikipedia is not censored, but there are image concerns, and in my view having a committed nationalist in a public position is just as bad and embarrassing to the project as a user with a silly (or downright "obscene") name. The [[World War I]] raging on in the !votes above mine is a perfect example of the chaos giving this user the mop and bucket will cause. Do we really want the potential of this sort of juvenile shitstorm following any decision Biru makes (no matter how right his decision was)? I don't care who's in the right or who's in the wrong, there's just too much time-wasting drama surrounding this guy. --'''Strong Oppose''' Answer to question 19 is very very weak.  As an admin, a user should be able to think and make judgements. This users answer does not indicate that they can do the job. Sorry'''Neutral.''' Im a bit worried about some of the things that some people have brought up (pedro and the edit summaries). The edits are good but Im still in the middle for this one, but I don't know why some people are complaining about a Romanian nationalist ecoming an administrator. <strong>Oppose per answers to #1, #2, #4, #5. Also per weak experience in most areas. Canvassing is also a problem to be considered.'''Neutral''' I've seen this user around Wikipedia: vandal-fighting, CSD, excellent work. However, when I noticed that the nominator has very few edits, providing the link by Daedalus, the made me pause a little.'''Oppose''' Needs more experience, especially with preparing the next update for DYK. Keep preparing some DYK next updates over the several months to prove yourself like [[User:Gatoclass|Gatoclass]] did and I'll feel different. (DYK... that some people find it distasteful to respond to every comment to you in an RFA, right?) '''<font color="#000000">'''Neutral'''.  I think you should have waited for your coaches to nominate you first.  Right now you are not ready.  Sorry, <font  face="georgia">''''''Neutral'''.  I probably would support if you had a more positive outlook on this RfA.  Also, I don't think you're that experienced in policy enforcing or article writing either.  Sorry. ''''''Regretful Oppose''' - I don't feel my questions were answered in a good way. I was kind of asking for processes which require admin assistance ([[WP:AFD]]/[[WP:RFPP]]). You just said you plan on banning and blocking, without saying where these banned and blocked users were found ([[WP:AN/I]]). Sorry :('''Regretful oppose''' - I think you're a great editor, but you need to fine tune a lot of areas just a little. I don't think the things you need to enhance are things you should be doing "on the job" as an admin. You need to understand mediation and civility policies above all else before coming up here. Your contributions are fine indeed, but not in the way that an administrator needs to display. Put your head into some policy and contribute to reporting vandals and do some monitoring at the page protection board. Once you've become thoroughly familiar with these things - the areas you advised you with to contribute to - and expand the general application of your skills, you should reapply, but I wouldn't recommend reapplying in the next three or four months. Head down, arse up and do these things, and you'll breeze through next time. --'''Strong Support''' I have found this editor to be a calming and concerned voice of reason. In a disagreement between myself and another, far more experienced editor, BQZip01 stepped into the fray and was the voice of wisdom and moderation. His Adminship would be very positive for Wikipedia. He is an excellent example of all that is and can be good about Wiki.'''Oppose''' - -you seem like a good editor on the whole but the image issues mentioned above bother me, as do some issues from the 1st RFA - I need a longer period of time to be sure of your familiarity with policies. --Doesn't understand the issues with his Kyle Field image beyond fair use (the image was clearly original research, and not appropriate for Wikipedia).  Administrators need to know image policy.'''Oppose:''' Possibly the most important quality an admin must have is good judgment, followed closely by intimate knowledge of Wikipedia custom and practices.  Anyone putting in/agreeing to an RfA ''three weeks'' after the last one is guilty of lacking either or both.  Three ''months'' would be well to the left of too soon.'''Strong Neutral''' - Switching from Support to Neutral, prefer not to take sides.'''Support''' - Great article builder, good work at ifd and is open about past mistakes.'''Support'''.  I think wikipedia could use another someone with experience dealing with IfD, and the man doesn't seem to edit in bad faith.  Also, he does appear to have the professionalism required, I think, to not abuse his powers in any case where someone is in a dispute with him.'''Oppose''' - Was going to support until I read the first two opposes and the diffs.I've been reviewing BQ for 2 hours now, and here is my opinion:#When Sandy votes, I listen.  Her example of his decidedly pointy edit has me greatly concerned.  Then there was his history with CC which resulted in an [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Cumulus Clouds|RFC]], ANI, and  [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:BQZip01/Comments|series of edits.]]  While none of these are blantant signs of a problematic user, I just keep getting an uncomfortable feeling about him.  There are a number of edits, such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABQZip01&diff=189883713&oldid=189852995 While I agree the spirit of the rules are to be followed, I disagree with your interpretation. Because I do, I feel you are accusing me of not following the spirit of the rules but following the letter. But how am I possibly doing that when it is explicitly permitted. I feel as if you are following your feelings and ignoring what is written.]  He was also warned for edit warring with CC in the exchange leading to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2F3RR&diff=191923960&oldid=191923433 this]  This eventually lead to Avruch "proposing that you and Cumulus Clouds be barred from further interaction"  In reviewing his history/edits, I get the sense that [[User:TheOtherBob]] was right when commenting [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FCumulus_Clouds&diff=190574491&oldid=190573771 My personal view of BQZ thus far is that he's not shown good judgment or much maturity in this instance. He seems to me to have prioritized "winning" over building an encyclopedia, and seems to believe that any action -- no matter its effect on other editors, the community, or even his own reputation -- is completely A-OK so long as it fits within his interpretation of a rule.]  This was the only resolution to garner more than a few endorsements.---''''''Oppose''' looking at the diffs, I'd say it's too soon for someone in a long-term dispute to get the bit.'''Oppose''' ostensibly per Sandy. I have encountered you before, though only slightly on FAC and I found him to be impestuous and slightly abrasive. Having since checked through your recent contribs, I have found this situation to have eased only slightly. That you continue the crusade with CC and didn't even mention it in Q3 shows a lack of judgement. I simply don't think you have the tact and nature to be an admin. I think that you would inflame a number of situations and act impulsively rather than looking deeper into situations. Whilst a lot of that is my gut-feeling, some of it is from plain observation. I really cannot support an you becoming an admin at this time. Regards.I'm on the fence. On one hand, I did grant you rollback rights, and I haven't seen you abuse that, but your past history does give me pause. I'm going to have to think about this, do some serious digging, and let this RfA take its course and see if anything else comes up. I'll make a decision on the last day of this thing (as long as you don't withdraw early). -''''''Neutral'''. This is an example of an RfA I would probably support if we ever got round to some method of making de-sysopping people easier. I fully respect this user's pledge to leave things like the Cumulus Clouds thing behind him, and I've seen great work from him too. But the overall feeling I get from reviewing the diffs presented by some of the opposes is that BQZip01 has some overall temperament and civility issues. Between the objection to AOR on principle and the overall difficulty in removing admins that later turn out to be suboptimal, I just don't feel comfortable supporting right now. ~ <font color="#228b22">'''Oppose''' Good user and contributor, however this RFA is premature. I would probably support an RFA 5-6 months later'''Oppose''' - per the above comments. General lack of experience.'''Weak oppose''' Needs more exposure to areas related to being an admin.

The latter really shows a lack of policy knowledge, one of our most important, and it was extremely recent. Still, beyond this, while I enjoy the candidate's gusto and zeal, there seems to be little being done (per talk pages) than vandalism reversions.'''Oppose''' - per the recent [[WP:BLP]] issue.  Mistakes in the past are one thing, however I have seen nothing other then your statement to show you have learned from this incident.'''''Hellllll No''''' per answer to Q6. Doesn't consult the rules ''at all'' when making an edit until it's been reverted? Giving someone like that admin tools is like having somebody drive a 16-wheeler blindfolded down a city street. In the rain. During rush hour.--'''Oppose''' Answers to questions 6 and 7 deeply concern me.  Answers to 4D and 4E show a lack of knowledge of all relevant policies.  Please consider gaining more experience and returning to RFA. ''''''Neutral''' I won't pile on another oppose, because I regard enthusiam as being important not to stifle, but there are too many concerns for me to support at the present time.

I feel that some people below here are being nitty-picky here and making a big deal out of nothing. <font face="comic sans ms">While the heart of the encyclopedia is its content, the truth is the flip side of [[WP:NOTPAPER]] is that this is an online community. There is place on WP for a specialist admin whose expertise is in online maintenance and vandalism fighting. He has shown he can be trusted, and I assume that Cobi will exercise appropriate discretion in areas with which he is unfamiliar.'''Support''' wiki will obviously benefit from Cobi's ability to block open proxies, block vandals found by his bot, his ability to edit protected pages and see deleted contribuions. There is some risk that having almost no experience nor passion over article writing Cobi would make incorrect decision with regard to passion article writers and editorial conflicts. I think we can take the risk as the potential benefits are quite strong.'''Support''' - Cobi's been a great guy the whole time I've known him, on Wikipedia and off. He'd make a great admin. // [[User:Hackmiester|hackmiester]]'''Support''' I know knothing of him outside his bot, but he seems like a wonderful user. [[Special:Contributions/Editorofthewiki|Editor]]'''Support''' I trust the user will use the tool appropriately. --<small>'''Oppose''' - While I feel that pile on,  opposes are anything but constructive or helpful I do not feel Cobi is any where near ready for adminship. I echo what all the above users are saying in the fact that Cobi has little to no edits outside of bot related duties and as such does not have proper experience to use all the tools. After reading over the nominations it appears that every one only stated Cobi’s expertise when it comes to bots, no strong evidence of solid admin related contributions and clearly no need for the tools. When asked whether he eventually branch out into new admin areas, he stated and I quote “Yes, but only after I have observed the process, read and understood all relating policies and protocols, and feel confident that I understand how things are done in that area.” – Adminship is not the time to observe the process and to read up on policies, that needs to be done as a user. Why request the tools and only state that you are planning on using a few of them, and how are we to know that he will only use those few? We are discussing issuing all the tools to this user, and about whether or not we trust this user to use the appropriately. At this point in time I do not trust Cobi to use them appropriately, with only a handful of contributions to [[WP:AIV|AIV]], [[WP:RFPP|RFPP]], [[WP:ANI|ANI]] ect… how can we see a ability to properly use the tools. Admins need to be well rounded, I am not saying they need to be experts in every part of the project, but well rounded, which Cobi is not. I feel this RfA is more of a popularity contest, due to the fact that Cobi has made a bunch of wikifriends here. Another issue was the use of cluebot to canvass users to !vote in his previous RfA, while that was dealt with it, and was a honest mistake, it really rubbed me the wrong way. If a user is only going to make bot related edits, then use (abuse) it to his gain? I personally do not know Cobi but from the few 2800+ contributions I reviewed, I was not impressed.'''Oppose''' I echo the concerns of the editors who have posted before me in this section; that communication is essential to any editor who requests administrative priveleges. I, and others I am certain, greatly appreciate all the hard-work you have put into Wikipedia but I do not feel you are ready yet to be endowed with the tools. More community interaction - maybe going to areas outside of your - well - favorite areas. Lord knows I ''hate'' voting on AFD's <sub>(...but so often am nominating articles for AFD...?)</sub>, but I try from time to time to make the effort to go and have my say. All I am saying is that I do not think you are a threat to Wikipedia or not worthy in any way, just that at this time I do not feel it would be appropriate of me to support you in this RFA if I was not fully convinced you could handle ''all'' of the aspects of being an administrator. --'''Strong Oppose''' I generally hate the argument about seeming power hungry, but 3 RfA's in less than 8 months?  But I have other concerns, he uses a bot, but has only 3K edits?  The most edits he's made to any one article is 5?  And the failure to adhere to the advice from previous RfA's.  Being an admin is about trust and about showing that you can listen to the expectations of the community as a whole.  Yes, that does mean jumping through some hoops, but it is like any job or school, in order to get what you want you sometimes have to do things you don't want to do.  Playing with a bot does not endear trust or validate expertise with policies and guidelines.'''Oppose''' - the reasons have been stated numerous times above.'''Oppose''': Hats off for your bot but, not enough mainspace edits. --[[User:Lahiru_k|<font color="blue">'''♪♫ ĽąĦĩŘǔ ♫♪'''</font>]] <font color="blue"><sup>[[User talk:Lahiru_k|walkie-talkie]] |I can't support because you have shown disregard to the opinion and recommendations of the community.

Still, that doesn't really say anything about how someone will use his or her admin tools. Being able to deal sensibly with difficult users (such as pov pushers) is an important quality for an admin to have. Such problems often require tough decisions and I think most editors feel a bit awkward when approaching that kind of problem? Unfortunately I agree that Coppertwig have shown incredibly poor judgment in this area so far (as shown above). And from what little I have come in contact with Coppertwig before haven't inspired confidence in this regard. I'm also a bit concerned about support for some dubious RfArb's (and as far as I know there was no discussion with the subject before jumping on the RfArb). Having looked through some of the edit history of Coppertwig I feel there is reason to question how well he/she understand policies. –&nbsp;'''Oppose''' You look like a potentially great editor, but I'm going to have to oppose. Like some other people, I don't think you've demonstrated a commitment to admin areas. I would contribute to XFD's, RFA's, RFC's etc and demonstrate an admin 'mindset'. Especially if you say you want the tools to contribute to AFD's I'd be looking for some evidence of contributions to the debates. Your response to the 3rd Q really impressed me though; I wouldn't hold that against you in the future. People make mistakes, we just learn from them.

Misapplying CSD categories by accident is pretty bottom of the barrel, as are short, tentative AfD nominations (note that the article in the diff provided below was basically [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ross_Golan_and_Molehead|snow deleted]].  So all the diff shows is that the editor was not verbose.  The diff does not show that the editor introduced a bad faith nomination (a problem for me) or a nomination based on unreflected ignorance (another big problem for me).  Reflected ignorance is ok.  I couldn't care less about [[John_Handcock#Famous_signature|how big his signature is]].  I also see nothing wrong with [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/吴国|this nomination]].  '''NOTHING'''.  Administrators may be ignorant of some of the hundreds of non-admin projects here.

All of the text (along with the title) is non-english.  Certainly if you know which language it was and which project could take care of it, you cold send it there, but why is CSD (and later AfD) an inappropriate choice?  And why, if it ''is'' an appropriate choice, is the wording somehow improper.  All in all, it seems to be making mountains out of molehills.'''Oppose''' Don't really want to pile-on, when the user seems a good Wikipedian with excellent intentions. But as well as points raised above, looking through the contribs I don't see evidence the user actually talks and works with others. An admin should be a leader, someone who can work with disparate people and help them work together, a conciliator. An admin has to resolve disputes, to do that you need to be able to understand other points of view. Can I suggest you get involved in some article work and try and act like an admin in adminny places. You don't need the tools to be a leader here.'''Oppose''' per Jon513 above.  While the candidate's actions were technically correct, I believe that they show an all-too-rigid mindset when it comes to administrative tasks.  Admins should be comfortable using their discretion in situations like that, not simply applying the rulebook when that produces a clearly nonsensical result.'''Oppose''' - Based on my review of this candidate - only 69% edit summary usage for minor edits, should be close to perfect after 2+ years on WP; no participation in Afd, Afc, Rfa, or AIV.  Plus the candidate has been editing mainly in NASCAR related areas.  I like admins to be multi-dimensional, not just focused on one.93 edits, 49 of which are too your own userspace.

I don't think one month of heavy activity, one year from the RfA, is enough to assess whether these problems have been fully addressed or if you fully understand current policy. I raise no accusations, I just don't feel the sample size is large enough for me to draw any definite conclusions about your suitability for adminship at this stage. I will be happy to re-evaluate my position next time round, but I can't support right now.'''Neutral''', I cannot oppose with such good answers to the questions (especially 4 and 5d), but I also believe strongly in looking at recent behavior as the best indicator.

The number of fails is irrelevent, look at what the candidate is like ''now''! —''''''Support''' Actually was planning to be neutral but after checking the track and rechecking it found that there is no chance of misuse of tools by the user and that the user is nomed and conomed by users I trust and  that the fact of the user's age swing votes in this RFA against the candidate in a RFA which even otherwise  is close and perhaps heading to the wire .It is impossible to find the age or gender of users unless they mention it or mention they students of a university or school etc but feel candidates should be judged only on basis of  there editing track.While I respect the opinion of editors to vote against candidates on basis of there age.'''Oppose''', as the evidence provided by others of immaturity and trying to avoid giving an honest opinion in answering the RfA questions worries me. ''''''Oppose'''  While several editors I respect are supporting you, I find the combination of multiple RfA's and the poor BLP an inexcusable combination: If you don't grok it by now, why would you ever?'''Oppose''' Per Skomorokh, Ynhockey and east718 with some caveats.  Age is not important to me.  I respect decisions made by people who would be less willing to support an admin under a certain age (though not those decisions where age is treated like a brightline).  Further I don't think that changing behavior following an unsuccessful RfA is a sign that the user is here only to be a sysop or isn't grounded in their desire to edit the encyclopedia.  An RfA is a nervewracking and sometimes horrifying experience.  Mine was successful but for someone who does not have a successful RfA, the appearance can be one of rejection.  They may say "well, it is clear that I'm not editing the way that people think I should be" and change behaviors.  I also am unconcerned about "adminmills" and admin coaching.  In my mind, most "admin coaching" involves a user who is already seen as a good candidate for the bit learning some of the tropes and idiosyncracies of RfA.  This is ''far'' less important now that we have fewer "cookie cutter" questions about blocks and bans and CDB's and what not.  Admin coaching was (IMO) partially designed to get around the possibility of failing an RfA by saying something silly like "A ban is where a user is indefinitely blocked" instead of the proper (but c'mon, equally silly) "A block is a technical measure used to prevent a user from editing and a ban is a community decision to...".  But the questions raised about your understanding and assessment of wikipedia policies are valid.  It is a red flag (to me) for a user to have been here as long as you have and not be able or willing to produce an answer to question 9.  Specifically, the answer produced was a complete dodge.  So I can't support this candidate.'''Regretful Oppose''', I'm sure you mean well but you need more experience I think. —'''Oppose''' - Some things don't concern me, such as your age, the number of RfA's you have had and the answer to Q9. Other things do however, your answers to the questions overall show a lack of necessary experience for the tools, particularly Q5. I am also a bit concerned over comments you have made across Wikipedia times, some of which make rather sweeping statements that may make unnecessary controversy - administrators can have jokes but should be generally mature and professional when communicating. You are certainly a good contributor, but I have unfortunately come to the conclusion you are not ready for the tools yet.The concerns raised by the opposers, conduct at [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/2008_IWF_action]], yes-man concerns, and apparent structuring of conduct in order to become an admin are troubling.'''Oppose'''. The Majorly log posting incident and[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Digwuren/Evidence#Evidence_presented_by_Bishonen Bishonen's evidence] lead to believe that the admin tools will likely be misused (though not necessarily ''abused''). I don't trust the candidate's judgement at this time.'''Changed to Sadly Oppose''' - While looking through some of Miranda's concern and Majorly's add-on, it seems that you have a hard time differentiating between humor and secondly "Per Special:Undelete/User:G1ggy/Chatlog Majorly (admin only)"..Chatlogs publishing is so so wrong :| and also [[Wikipedia:Editor review/The Random Editor 2|this]] since you leaked private info/conversation and thus can not really be trusted..soory..but you are a Great Guy and Crikey I would love to have you as an admin, but your immaturity takes the better of you..<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:medium;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;">Unfortunately, too liable to give into the temptation to say things he knows perfectly well he shouldn't.

I was a little confused reading about how you'd like to use the tools in areas you currently work in, which, frankly is the mainspace. I understand you were probably referring to disputes and vandalism, but administrators shouldn't concentrate their efforts on articles they contribute to, at least not exclusively. And, it gives you a chance to block and ban people? Strange thing to say. I know you tempered it with "last resort", but the tools shouldn't be desired to give you the chance to start blocking and banning users.

Sincerely,'''Support''' I can't really hold his contributions on another wiki against him.  Maybe he uses a public restroom and doesn't flush IRL.  what does that have to do with admin access on wikipedia?  As for past problems, bygones are bygones.  As this wiki gets older and bigger, it will be harder and harder to find admins if we keep looking backward.  Clearly a dedicated editor.'''Support''' I agree with everyking, it's time to put the past in the past. Is Ed a little crazy? Sure. I think Ed is sincerely needed to keep some of the rowdy science editors from tearing this project apart. His firm, but polite approach is just what the doctor ordered. I totally disagree with Ed's politics and views on science, but I recognized long ago that having differing voices is always better. --'''Support''' &mdash; I agree that, ultimately, he shouldn't be a community servant--but the Arbitrary Committee, being illegitimate, has no legitimate authority to desysop someone.  If he needs to be desysopped, only the community at large has the legitimate authority to do that.  He should be resysopped, in accord with the original consensus to make him a servant of the community, unless and until the community at large expresses a wish to overturn that decision.'''Support'''. I believe that Ed has the best interests of Wikipedia at heart. I'm prepared to give him another chance.Per DS: no reflection on Ed Poor personally, as he's always struck me as polite, sincere, and well-meaning. The Conservapedia thing doesn't bother me - in fact, I'm glad he recognizes that a certain approach is more appropriate there rather than trying to force it here. I just don't think that the extra buttons are a good idea; we're not talking one isolated incident, but a well-developed pattern that suggests that things are likely to come to grief. He's doing well as a contributor, and the rationale for returning the tools seems weak. Rescuing worthy articles from premature deletion is a laudable goal, but not one that requires tools (though if you need deleted revisions to work on something along these lines, let me know). ''''''Oppose.''' I was not around at the time of the previous drama surrounding Ed Poor. But http://www.conservapedia.com/User:Ed_Poor and the example in the (as yet unanswered) Q. 28 above are not indicative of a mindset compatible with holding a position of trust in a collaborative, neutral encyclopedia project. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">Although I've never met the candidate on occasions prior to this RfA, I feel that with the luck of hindsight what could and possibly will happen if the administrators bit was to be implemented as a feature. Clearly we can see that although time has passed (quite a bit of it, I might add) we have some recent edits which are concerning; notably the one posted here by Pedro in the #2 oppose.'''Oppose''' This user has demonstrated a very biased POV, abuse of power and 'power tripping' on this and other Wikis. He has also made his extremely negative opinion of this wiki known throughout the internet.

''''''Neutral''' While I think a bureaucrat's nomination, co-nomed with an admin, weighs a lot, in this case I feel it's not enough to automatically support. Both supporters and opposers are mentioning some valid points (and some prejudice as well I'm afraid) and I could not make my mind up by looking through his contribs and thus I will stay neutral in this case. '''I thought your comments in Karanacs request were pretty disturbing, to say the least. I feel like if you invite criticism of yourself you shouldn't cry a river when someone criticises you.

When a user removes a message from their own talk page, it is taken as acknowledgment that they have read it and, obviously, it follows that they do not wish to reply.  Restoring the comment, particularly when it is nothing but a personal attack, shows a severe lapse in judgment. --'''Oppose'''. I agree with Friday: "I don't like to see candidates who have prepared (or been prepared) for adminship." Clicking on the diffs in this RFA, especially of the interactions between Enigmaman and Balloonman prior to nomination, I come away with an impression I don't like: of a candidate being intensively, obsessively groomed for adminship, whether ready or not. Followed by opposers getting dogpiled on by the nominator and others on this page, getting told that they need to move their !vote, that they're casting stones, etc[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Enigmaman&diff=215720111&oldid=215718712] (no way of winning that one: if you ''don't'' give a reason for opposing, you're failing to "discuss"; if you do give one, you're casting the first stone).[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Enigmaman&diff=215633893&oldid=215633650][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Enigmaman&diff=215633650&oldid=215633600][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Enigmaman&diff=215634545&oldid=215633893][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Enigmaman&diff=215635373&oldid=215635365][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Enigmaman&diff=215665903&oldid=215665053][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Enigmaman&diff=215667639&oldid=215666903] The nominator feels Friday might as well object to pre-marriage counselling.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Enigmaman&diff=215631638&oldid=215631395] .  But the problem there, for me is the impression that the candidate is being trained for his wedding (=his RFA) rather than for actual married life (=adminship).

People are in fact permitted to support or oppose based on their ''impression.'' Feel free to follow this comment with a thread about how ridiculous and baffling I'm being, of course; but it might be as well to take it straight to the talkpage.Poor behavior in the incident with Deacon, as Irpen had noted. &mdash;'''Neutral''', leaning toward an unhappy oppose. I see too many instances of needing to be right, and also needing the other to be wrong. This impression comes in combination with an operative hecticness I'm not unfamiliar with but don't like too much. I have seen fresh administrators assiduously getting involved in all sorts of places, posting at all the *choke* "high-drama" places at once, instead of focusing on one locus where they could actually be helpful with depth and due diligence. I am not saying this is the kind of administrator Enigmaman will be, but currently the concerns outweigh the rest. On a final note, not all supporters did the candidate a favor (or the process any service) the way they pounced on some of the opposers. This behaviour should stop, period, but I guess the comment doesn't really belong here. I'm only mentioning it because it annoyed me enough to post this statement. Still, it isn't Enigmaman's fault if he is being protected by a pack of pitbulls, so I'll put in "neutral" rather than "oppose". (Or maybe I'm just scared of being bitten). ---'''Strong Support'''.

Obviously a highly qualified candidate, definitely knows the ropes.  His responses have left me confident that the civility issues will improve.  The examples brought up by Pete in his oppose did pretty much suck, but that was a while ago, and after a very thorough look at Epbr's recent contribs, I've seen nothing like that. He's willing to accept feedback in the future, too, in case he does slip up.  He knows he's got stuff to work on and has shown a lot of willingness to.

Even when we had disagreements, we resolved them in amicable terms.'''Oppose''', along the same lines as Aboutmovies, above. I came in on the [[Oregon State Capitol]] nomination a little late, and was puzzled by the lack of collegiality in Epbr's approach. His/her initial feedback was helpful, but the lack of followup seemed dismissive in a way that I couldn't understand. The issue was ultimately resolved, and I'd be inclined to say no harm, no foul. But [[Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates/archive23#Five noms|this discussion]] concerns me. Legitimate concerns were raised by numerous editors, clearly good faith efforts to clarify what was and was not acceptable behavior, and in no way casting doubt on Epbr's character; yet Epbr's first comment was to "demand an apology" from one of the editors, unnecessarily raising the tenor of the discussion, and utterly ignoring all other comments. I will say that I've had pleasant interactions with Epbr on [[WP:GA]], but the items listed above betray what I consider a pretty significant lack of collegiality. I would be happy to reconsider my opinion, but would need to see some specific commentary from Epbr on those two incidents that indicates an understanding of the problems I've raised. -'''Oppose.'''

While I strongly doubt the user would purposely misuse the tools, I'm equally certain that you cannot possibly pick up all you need to know to be an admin from Huggle. Just my two cents.'''Oppose''' I find that you don't have enough patience for the tools. Article building and collaborations are good ways of learning patience and other aspects of adminship--'''Oppose''' &mdash; I view self-noms as ''prima facie'' evidence of power hunger.A couple of factors bug me - (a) absence of article work, (b) a bit too much sarcasm and volatility in handling important issues, which may possibly become an issue if you obtain the blocking and deletion buttons.

Does not recognize the value of [[WP:N]] in terms of making judgements about what articles should and should not be included in Wikipedia.Adminship is not a reward for good editing, and while Everyking is a prolific editor, his administrative actions were often questionable, and I do not think he has the judgment to make correct choices as an admin.'''Weak oppose''' unless I can see some more clueful answers to the questions.

I appreciate your dedication to the project, but I feel that you have too little experience on Wikipedia. You joined on November 4, 2006, and you edited heavily in November, but sorta died off in December. You have been a good vandal-fighter and article-builder, and I commend you for your work in this namespaces, but if you want to be an admin, you need to have more edits in the Wikipedia-namespace (at least a few hundred), and also more edits in general (2000+ is a good number). I suggest you withdraw the RfA after receiving some more RfA votes, and then consider re-applying once you have more experience with the project. ''''''Weak Oppose'''. I'm not one to count edits, but your lack of Wikipedia namespace edits show a lack of working with process/procedure.

FMF, though, seems, consistent with the analyses of (to name three) Regent, Moonriddengirl, and MrPrada, possessed of a sound sense of judgment, a deliberative temperament, a keen intellect, conversance with policy (and of the nature of the areas whereof the policy governing which he might not be acquainted), and a collegial, collaborative personality, which conclusion is, on the whole, bolstered by the history of his involvement with certain BLP issues, including those surrounding [[Celebrity sex tape]], discussed infra, which involvement demonstrates an ability to apply policy consistent with the community's understanding of policy, if not optimally to communicate relative to that understanding (it should probably be noted, too, that the inclusion of the "Rumors" section about the propriety of which there appears to exist some dispute seems to have commanded a consensus of involved editors before protection&mdash;whether that has since changed, I haven't undertaken to see, but ''post facto'' changes in the views of the community wouldn't seem particularly useful to one seeking to adjudge FMF's actions&mdash;and that Sceptre's construction of BLP, one that he would, I'm sure, admit is much more strict than that embraced by the community, was rejected by many editors, if not always in the unfortunately curt manner adopted once or twice by FMF, blunting, certainly, submissions that the substance of FMF's behavior bears out a misunderstanding of policy and practice or is somehow wrong; in any event, we have enough admins who err, to the multi-faceted detriment of the project, in applying BLP absolutely, and it is heartening to find a candidate who appreciates nuance in the same way the community writ large do), such that I am able to conclude with a good deal of confidence that [[User:Jahiegel/Views on Wikipedia/Requests for adminship|the net effect on the project of the candidate's being sysop(p)ed should be positive]].'''Neutral''' : as I see no oppose or support reasons -- <small> <span style="border:1px solid #6699FF;padding:1px;background:#6699FF">'''Moral support''', but I recommend [[WP:NOTNOW|withdrawal]] unless you want to be [[WP:SNOW|snowed]] by opposes. I don't think you are gaming the system (i.e. taking the MMORPG approach), but some editors got that impression because of your sig & user page, and because you've only contributed substantially to a few articles. Based on what I've seen at RfAs that tide is very difficult to reverse. I found your article contribution genuinely positive, and your involvement with mediation in good faith as well (I reviewed the case). You have good writing skills, so you can definitely use those in upcoming months do dispel the idea that you're doing it for [[WP:TROPHY|promotion]].'''Oppose''' I think an RfC probably would have been a good next step in looking into adminship, instead of self nomination. As mentioned by a few people already, you have some glaringly obvious issues. Plus, I seriously, seriously, seriously, seriously... seriously '''HATE''' your user name.'''Oppose'''. Haven't had a lot of interaction with this candidate, but by reading the opposes above, a few problems such as the username and less article building concern me.I have given this request a great deal of thought, and my primary inclination is to '''support''' the request. Geni has come on a great deal since he was originally desysopped during the Arbitration decision at [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Daniel Brandt deletion wheel war]]: he has presented an exemplary level of civility in inter-editorial communications, and has been happy to handle enquiries concerning his on-Wiki contributions. I find it encouraging that he has not appeared hasty to regain the administrator tools, although he has been happy to participate in the type of duties that one often sees in administrators: [[WP:SPAM|spam links]] patrolling ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atcham&diff=prev&oldid=179763524]), policy development ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Verifiability&diff=prev&oldid=188495425]), etc... Geni has not been afraid to voice his opinion on matters since he lost his administrator bit, which is similarly encouraging: it is all too easy to revert to "perfect wikipedian" mode in preparation for a re-sysopping RfA, and the fact that he has remained an honest, fair editor, who is not afraid to hold down the truth, for fear of opposition at a future RfA seems to suggest that he will not be afraid to undertake non-routine actions, so long as they benefit the project. All things considered, I am confident that Geni's regaining the access to the administrator tools will benefit the project as a whole. I would advise him to be more careful in the future, and to avoid a repeat of the Brandt incident—having said that, I don't think Geni is stupid enough to wheel war a second time. Good luck with your RfA: it will be a controversial one, but one that I hope you can pull through successfully. I only hope this week is not too painful :) Best regards, <span style="font-family:verdana">[[User:AGK|'''AGK''']]'''Support''' Geni has been around forever and I always enjoy hearing his valuable, unique perspective on things.  Short answers?  That’s Geni’s style, but he gets his message across.  He’s dedicated to the project and I believe him when he says he’s learned from his mistakes.  The tools will help him in the work he’s productive and good at doing.  --'''Support'''.  Didn't realize the wheel war thing went down since I've been here (a simpler and happier wiki-time :-).  But having looked at [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Daniel Brandt deletion wheel war |the case]] and per AGK's comment above, I have to support.  I appreciate that he didn't rush his renom (plus that he's here at all, he could have bypassed the community and appealed to ArbCom), and I appreciate the forthright manner of his work here.  I figure veteran editors probably have their own firm conclusions about what happened, but I encourage newer ones here to dig around into the circumstances surrounding the desysop.'''Oppose''' &mdash; I view self-noms as ''prima facie'' evidence of power hunger.'''Oppose''' because of a solid history of wheel warring.  The use of sockpuppets also concerns me. I find it amusing that you accused Jimbo of introducing [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Geni&diff=prev&oldid=134214135 "flawed policy without discussion"] but that's exactly how I would describe the fromowner system.&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;'''Neutral'''. I've seen both good and bad things from Geni, and I don't know how I can lean either way at this point.Geni is highly knowledgeable on images and copyright and I've long thought that s/he is an asset to the project. '''I've had the pleasure of meeting Geni in real life, and can safely say that he isn't evil or crazy. He's very dedicated to this, and related projects like Commons, very knowledgable, and has been around for years. The wheel war was over 18 months ago. It's long-forgotten history. Strongly endorse this candidate! ''''''Support''' - desysopping Geni indefinitely was excessive.  Geni always did an outstanding job as an admin - in particular, his/her work with image issues stands out in my mind. --'''Support''' (changed from neutral).  If he blows it again, he'll be de-sysopped much more rapidly than before with far less debate.  That would effectively guarantee that any subsequent RfA would have a near-zero possibility of passing and close the issue permanently.  —'''Support'''. I never had any personal issues with her, and I think with the Daniel Brandt article finally deleted it's time to give her a fresh start on this one.'''Weak support''': Although I share Badger Drink's concerns, I believe in second chances (usually) and think that equating RfA terseness with poor overall communication skills is sorta judging a book by its cover. Even so, RfA would be a good place to demonstrate any relevant skills, so my support remains weak.'''Oppose''' I'm trying to wrap my head around the particularly parsimonious prose (sorry, couldn't help it) in the answer to my question.  In my opinion the only valid question for a new admin is whether or not they can be trusted to use the tools properly.  Different people make that determination in different ways, but here we have a case where the community (or some subset of) explicitly made that decision in the past.  I'm not saying that Jimbo and arbcom '''have to be right''' here but I also don't see any contrition about past actions.  Either they were wrong (broadly or narrowly) and the user is applying to regain the tools via normal channels or they were right (broadly or narrowly) and the user has changed in such a manner as to void the past concerns.  The answers to Q10 don't show a defense of past actions or contrition.  I'm sorry.'''Oppose''' per Nick mallory, Mailer diablo, and Wisdom89. [[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider]] deserved a second chance, but here I'm not so sure. Mr. Cage did an awesome job in that movie, by the way.--'''Oppose''' based on short answers.

I would not feel comfortable with you closing AfDs.'''Strong Oppose''' I have supported many deletionists here. I essentially co-nominated one yesterday.  What I want in someone who closes AfDs --regardless of their general tendency-- is two things: one is that they know the standards, and the other is that they are not reckless, a sign that  they will  not follow their own opinion rather than the community. On the first point, some of those AfD opinions are in clear ignorance or defiance of accepted standards: for example the one on [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Introduction to evolution (2nd nomination)]]--a type of article which is accepted and not a content fork--and this is a particularly good one of its type. Or the one on [[Opinion polling for the United States presidential election, 2008]]--where a whole group of good articles were nominated--a nomination of his that almost nobody supported--and where in fact the articles were specifically supported as an example for a policy page.  Or [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Japanese people]] one of a type of pages that is also well established. Or [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chicken (young gay)]] where he seems not to have even do a gsearch before nominating--as pointed out to him there were hundreds of hits each in GBooks and GScholar.  (I'm not going to talk about the popular culture ones, where standards are not well established--I won;t blame anyone for disagreeing with me on these.)  On the second point, he admits he came here reckless, and I don;t see how anyone could take the chance that he's had a total change of mind. He expects the community to give him power to do what he knows he does in defiance of standards and established policy. If there's any inclusionist who does similarly, I'll oppose him just as strongly.  ''''''Weak oppose''' My concerns are not quite as broad or deep as those of the inestimable DGG, perhaps because I do see there to be a good bit to commend the candidate and to speak well of, in particular and most relevantly, his judgment; I do, though, find a good bit, as outlined by DGG, et al., that disquiets, and I find in the end that, even as I am certain that Guest9999 should not abuse or misuse intentionally the tools, and even as I think him on the whole to be conversant in policy and to know well whereof the policy and practice surrounding and guiding which he does not know, I am not sure that he might not misuse avolitionally (e.g., by substituting, knowingly or not, his views with respect to policy for those of the community, a quality that is not so pernicious in the interpreting of community-wide, consensus-based discussions, where the views of the community are often borne out clearly and where decisions are, in any case, readily seen, but is rather problematic in the undertaking of speedy deletion, where deletions undertaken in an overbroad fashion, one inconsistent with the mandate of the community that the criteria for speedy deletion be construed narrowly, often go unchallenged or unnoticed, to the detriment of the project, the good faith of the deleter notwithstanding), such that I cannot conclude with any grand degree of confidence that [[User:Jahiegel/Views on Wikipedia/Requests for adminship|the net effect on the project of the candidate's being sysop(p)ed should be positive]]; my oppose is, though (not that this really matters), "weak", largely because I imagine (but can't at this point reasonably expect) that the deliberative temperament and sense of judgment of which Guest9999 appears, at least on a somewhat cursory investigation, usually to be possessed might work well to mitigate the effects his beliefs about what policy ought to be (which he is, of course, welcome to hold and welcome to advance, and for the holding and advancing of which he surely ought not to be knocked) might have on his performance of the purely ministerial role of sysop.'''Neutral''', leaning toward support. I'll be frank in saying that my hesitation has a lot to do with Guest9999's deletion views. I wouldn't oppose an RfA for deletionism alone, but if I expect the editors' views to substantially influence their interpretation of deletion policies and guidelines and XfD/DRV consensuses, I consider that sufficient grounds for opposition. In this case I'm fairly certain the candidate would apply his slanted (though reasonable) interpretations of policies and guidelines in closing XfDs, but he doesn't strike me as an editor who would blatantly disregard a clear consensus. Also to his credit, I've always found Guest9999 to be civil in XfD discussions. —I strongly support this nomination.

Beyond that, InDeBiz1's previous comment to the same editor was quite stern as it was, and if that didn't get the editor's attention, screaming harder and waving legal threats around instead of dropping in on AN/I or otherwise getting the attention of an admin showed poor judgment.

He's been active across a broad spectrum of editing areas - sure there have been some possible erroes, but even experiended admins make mistakes..... :-) In my limited dealings with him, I've always found him courteous and friendly. What I '''am''' concerned about is that this RfA seems to be moving towards, not an opinion of his editing and/or contributions to WP, but to his choice of userboxes. Taking that to the logical extreme, that would imply that no editor with anything other than uncontroversial WP edit-related userboxes could be trusted to give an unbiased review to any article - atheists would be biased against religious articles, LGBT editors would object to anything said against Judy Garland, Protestant editors would be vandalising Catholic articles, Trekkies (or is it Trekkers these days ?) would be adding articles on quantum flux in photon torpedo matrices.. etc. etc. - none of which I believe to be the case (except maybe the Trekkie one.. :-)) - someone please tell me if I'm wrong. Editors MUST try and retain an editorial impartiality - for those occasions where they don't, WP has multiple review processes. As I read this, the particular userbox mentioned, which the candidate did not create themselves, has been approved for use and is probably used right now by other editors - so does that mean they're all unsuitable for adminship ? If so, then presumably, anyone with a 'I believe in religion x' userbox should be excluded from adminship for the same reason ? What if an editor was given adminship and then decided to add this userbox afterwards ? Does that mean they're suddenly not an impartial editor and will start biasing their editing ? Can we please drag this back to an opinion of whether this person would be a good administrator or not ? '''IF''' he exhibits a bias against religious articles, they can be easily reverted, and his adminship removed. Ok, that's the longest paragraph I've put on WP - I need a lie down :-)'''Support.'''

The experiment is not counted as successful only if the candidate passes, and we'll have good data regardless of the end result. I rarely oppose these days because I think the project needs more dedicated users with the mop. However, I see an editor who upon failing consistently to earn the community's trust to wield the mop has devised an alternative system in which he presents himself through rose tinted glasses, and tries to limit opposition by indicating that all opposition should be dealt with in the Q&A period.'''Oppose''' Editor has good intent, but doesn't have nearly enough experience.

Such has never been, and never will be, appropriate for an administrator. I also do not sense a strong need for the tools, especially for someone that has so vehemently put down this process while making the issue more divisive within the community.

I'm a bit concerned at the exponential leap in RfA standards - it sometimes seems an editor needs a perfect record of creating multiple FA-class articles with nary a typo, adding penetrating insights to every policy page, preserving the grace and gentility of a saint at all times, and maintaining a 100% edit summary record even in the sandbox. On the specific issues - the article on [[Counterpoint LLC]] is a one-line stub that doesn't assert notability, but that surely isn't a heinous crime. Out of 17,000 contributions, a single minor mistake in creating an inoffensive non-notable stub is nothing. Edit summaries? Yes, do something about that, like turn on the automated prompt. The answer to question 5? Too aggressive, and not the right approach, but is offset by the rest of your record.'''Neutral''' - I really can't oppose, since you have such great contributions. The things holding me from support are the low edit summary usage, and the answer to Q5. Regarding the low edit summary usage, I would strongly recommend turning on that setting in the preferences.

I acknowledge that MONGO has made a huge stack of valuable edits since his desysopping, but I just do not trust him with the tools again.'''Oppose''' with deep regret. I really like MONGO as a person, and think he means very well. And he's often right about stuff, important stuff...

Not everyone is suited for the drudgery, general scrutiny, slings and arrows, and second guessing by the peanut gallery (here and elsewhere) that come with being an admin here... also, per Martinp and Alison. John, I don't think MONGO is necessarily addicted to drama, it rather does sometimes seem to seek him out instead of the other way round. ++'''Strong Oppose''' Was incredibly incivil in my only interaction with him.  On the [[Salty Walrus]] article, an admin denied the speedy, and his response was to put it back on.  I removed it and asked him [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&diff=prev&oldid=176086842 to take it to AFD].

However, he is far too passionate regarding issues close to his heart, and is immovable on positions he holds regarding important matters in the community. While I can absolutely understand some of his opinions regarding badsites etc, and his tenacity and defence of his positions could be considered admirable, his behaviour towards Alison and Krimpet in the recent past - two admins whom I have never seen acting in an untoward manner - and his serial assumptions of bad faith indicate that he is currently not suitable for this role. With enormous regret, ~'''Oppose''' The fact there was an RFC just two months ago, about constant civility problems, compounded by recent discussions (as noted by Alison), makes this vote inevitable for me.'''Oppose''' -- I have lost confidence in Mongo's ability to ever properly exercise the functions of an administrator. --<font face="Futura">'''Oppose''' Lar sums up my thoughts on this matter nicely. As for, "...MONGO can be gruff at times; but, he's much tamer than many who still wield the mop.": poor conduct in one user is not an excuse for allowing it in others. Administrators are supposed to be exemplary in their adherence to our policies on civility, and this candiate is not. MONGO is knowledgeable and obviously an experienced editor, but I would not trust him with the tools.'''Oppose''' per Cla68 and others.

Unfortunately, his words and actions since then have proved me wrong. He is a conflict magnet, who sees the world in ''Back/White, Good/Bad, Us/Them'' terms. Worse yet, he can be a persecutor with a demonstrated streak of [[McCarthyism]]; If the ''commies'' don't readily present themselves, he actively seeks them out, even looking under beds if necessary. Thus he has, sadly, made himself into an embarrassment. The ill-will and controversy he creates have come to outweigh any of his positive contributions. He's had his shot at the mop and blew it...''big time'' (because MONGO doesnt do small:).

Admin tool knowledge ought come best with access to them, just as editing format and markup is learned best through editing (hence the sandbox and Don't Bite the Newcomers). Candor in answering questions is of paramount importance (rather than prepackaged answers that are political and "sound" good). Realizing that editing BLP articles about family can introduce bias and yet working hard to prevent bias is noble and in the best interests of Wikipedia.

While I do agree with [[User:Cosmic Latte|Cosmic Latte]] ("what differentiates her from countless ''other'' great editors who are not administrators") and [[User:Ssbohio|SSBohio]] ("wanting to delete articles, and there are plenty of admins willing to do that already"), perhaps more great editors ''should'' be admins, and even with plenty of admins willing to delete articles, there's always a backlog (is there not?) and current admins could always use additional support and help, eh?

You know that you are no where near the expectations of the community, but you want cry "it is a big deal" when your RfA goes down in flames.  Normally, I wouldn't be this harsh with a person with as few edits as you, but you set yourself up as a person who reads ''Requests for Adminship every day'' and you want to write an essay on '''I plan to write a Wikipedia essay about my RFA experience.'''  You know it is going to fail.  This is beyond pointy, it is borderline disruptive.  As for it being a big deal, even Jimbo Wales has said that adminship is a bigger deal than it used to be... that's old news.---''''''Oppose''' I don't feel labelling the RFA an experiment should automatically make it a failure. Nor should whether or not he wants to write, even whine, about his RFA experience - many people who fail RFAs do that. But it does seem to me the editor wants it both ways. He wants to be assessed as an experienced editor, but has just 500 edits on this account. Asked to specify previous accounts, he says that's too hard to remember and he wants to leave the past behind. But if he is to be assessed solely on this account, the only answer can be that more experience is needed.'''Strong Oppose''' per above.

I substantially agree with RyanGerbil10 that article-writing ''per se'' is not crucial for adminship, as the two things are more or less entirely unrelated; vandal-fighting is far more likely to give rise to a regular need for the tools. However, I think that an admin who focuses on maintenance needs, at the very least, to have some experience of XfD or FAC discussions, or something else which involves discussion and a more sophisticated and subtle understanding of policy. The mechanical, repetitive nature of vandal-fighting means that it isn't enough, on its own, to allow me to determine whether this candidate has the good judgment and discernment to be a capable administrator. Edits like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roast_%28comedy%29&diff=prev&oldid=182574224 this] show that the candidate is on the right track and that he has some understanding of [[WP:RS]] and other policies and guidelines relating to content; however, I urge him to get more involved in XfD and policy discussions, or in collaborative improvement of content. It doesn't have to be article-writing, as I realise that isn't everyone's cup of tea; how about helping out with the [[WP:WIKIFY|backlog of unwikified articles]], working on [[WP:PORTAL|portals]], or becoming a [[WP:GA|good article reviewer]]?

Also, I don't approve of "hassling" opposers [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DanBealeCocks&diff=prev&oldid=206986295 as appears to be happening here]'''Oppose''' This is going to be a long comment, so I'll apologise in advance. Firstly, I'm again surprised that the candidate is here at RfA, so very soon after the last RfA, which was just over a month ago. I made a comment on that RfA which prompted the candidate to withdraw the RfA and admit that accepting a nomination was a clear error of judgement, so I said I was happy to withdraw my comment and treat the RfA as a declined nomination, but we're back here at RfA after another month, now this is the 3rd request in 4 months and the second which has been accepted. I'm a little disappointed at the nominators, so I'll start there first, they're all fairly intelligent people who should really know that nominating a candidate a couple of months after their last RfA outing is likely to result in another failed request, so I'm at a loss as to what the hell they're doing. I can quite happily shout at candidates self nominate every other week, but when someone is being poked and prodded with nominations from users who really should know better, it's only natural they'll assume they do know better and are likely to accept a nomination. That doesn't absolve them of responsibility to determine whether they should be at RfA, and in that respect, I'm still not happy that Stormtracker94's judgement is up to scratch, especially when I told them to wait more than 5 or 6 weeks before accept another nomination. Potential administrators not listening or professing to listen then ignoring advice worry me. The deleted page about trying to change RfA (which again, I seem to have been the first to comment on) was, I feel, an indication that the user has an unhealthy interest in passing RfA, which on it's own isn't a bad thing, I don't care if someone who I feel would make a great administrator passes RfA after having a great deal of interest in it, but when it's someone who has recently failed one RfA and had a second withdrawn, mildly outwith process, as I was obviously in a very charitable mood that day, it starts to become rather troubling. I have a few concerns which I'll share, my first concern is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGiovanni_di_Stefano&diff=206973395&oldid=206954920 this] which is in no way sensible behaviour for any user, and it worries me immensely as to how such an attitude would impact on the project if the user was given access to the block, deletion and page protection tools. I'm also left wondering how much the user knows when it comes to the biographies of living persons policies and the role of OTRS volunteers within the project. I don't even see any evidence that the user even paid a cursory glance at the AfD, which Lawrence provides all the details of the situation they are asking for in the diff above. The deleted page detailing the new RfA process the candidate here wishes to propose again showed signs that the candidate had a impulsive response to something, and there's again no evidence they had looked at WT:RFA or were familiar with the subject of adminship reform. I believe I checked the users contributions at the time and saw no recent edits to WT:RFA, which I believe demonstrates an inability to communicate with interested parties on a subject. I'm a little concerned that I had to fix the comments of the user in their own RfA, they appear not to be able to correctly format wiki-markup, which is a tiny little problem, but admins have access to the MediaWiki namespace, blacklists and such, where a little error can prevent a spam filter or titleblacklist working, and I've just got the feeling it's indicative of an overall lack of experience - that's something difficult to quantify, but that's my thoughts. Finally, I'm unhappy with the candidate agreeing with the endless harassment of those Opposing above, that's jolly bad form and again begs the question how they would behave if given access to administrator tools.'''Oppose''' - low edit count, neglected to read self-nom instructions. reccomend snow/towel/notyet closure.

For the record >> '''Adminship:No Joke'''.'''Oppose''' I started off wanting to support this Rfa, having read the Q and A section. I really take the view that people can and do turn over a new leaf and become fully acceptable. However reading the Transhumanist replies to opposers did indicate to me a significant problem, it's hard for me to define, I was going to say it's an attitude problem but that is not quite it, it's more like a misconception of how to deal with people <tonnes of rambling removed, Go read the book [[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]>. I'd be happy to support you in the future if I see a real change in attitude, I would even be happy to nominate you myself.'''Oppose''' (ec w/Orfen) I get the sense that you feel this is a trophy you deserve, and it's anything but that. I also get the sense you've never served in a real-life position of leadership, because if you had you would see why your RFAs keep failing. This is not a reward. It's not a prize. It's not a license to do what you want and say what you will. Based just on your behavior during this RFA alone, it's clear that much drama would ensue quickly if you received the tools. -'''Neutral'''. As noted, the candidate's answer to Question 4 (which I posted) is a good answer, and I think that the candidate would indeed be a benefit to the project if granted the tools. Some of the comments under oppose, both by and about the candidate, give me pause, however. I'd like an answer to my follow-up question (under #6 by Elkman) before supporting or opposing.'''Support'''.  Everything here in the right tone.  --Sorry, but you do not understand Speedy Deletion criteria, nor notability.  In Q10, item 1 you say "There is some claim of notability, but I'm sure there are many, many of c.c. with a record of 12 year, so it won't be sufficient." But "sufficient" is not the basis for passing AfD, it's any indication or assertion of notability.  it has to go to Prod or AfD.  For no.3, you'd delete the school article because 300 students is too few to be notable.WP:CSD specified that A7 non-notable can not be used for schools, because they are never unquestioned.  and even at AfD, the size is not the main criterion--its the notability as shown by references. a small school can be very important, and have  references to prove it. The school might well by many people's view be non-notable, but it wouldn't be because of small size alone. For Q4, you are again judging by whether the notability is sufficient (you are right that it almost certainly is not), but the article asserts it is, so it can not be a speedy for non-notability.  You clearly need more experience with policy. '''Sorry, Question 10 did it for me. Considering that you don't give an indication of any specific areas you are intending to work in, I have to assume that you might be working in any or, indeed, all of them and I do not trust you with CSDs at this time.'''Oppose''' per DGG. Sorry, but your answers were awful. However, your user page and past edits give me no major worries.  Can you try again in two months after you work a bit at [[WP:AfD]]?Does not have the maturity to be an administrator. I've lost count of the number of times you've retired this year. Suggest withdrawal. ''''''Oppose''' Sorry, but I think its going to [[WP:SNOW|snow]] today. ''''''Support''', even though yesterday some IP was attacking him (probably about vandal work) on articles.  That's probably a good sign.  ''''''Support''' Vandal fighter and has a very good track and no concerns.'''Support'''. Looks like a good vandal fighter. DarkFalls' diff ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avenged_Sevenfold&diff=206382982&oldid=206382849]) is obviously clumsy, but everyone makes mistakes.'''Support''' per inclusion on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Le_Grand_Roi_des_Citrouilles#Nice_comments_other_contributors_said_about_or_in_support_of_me.21 this list].  Sincerely, --<font face="Times New Roman">'''Support.''' As I spend more time around here, I see Thingg more and more often doing a yeoman's job and beyond. Keep it up! :-)'''Oppose''' per J Milburn. I don't think the tools would be abused, but perhaps misused'''Oppose''' If Thingg had the deletion tools, he would have deleted the Avenged Sevenfold page, and would have then ''lost'' his tools if he was up for recall. Also with the hacked account, warnings won't deter somebody who has already hacked an account, and a different direction needs to be persued in that situation. ''''''Oppose'''.  Seems to have too mechanistic a view of policies and procedures. --I'll stick this in here for now, I did see the name and thought I would be able to support, but some of the behaviour from your co-nominator has left a bitter taste in my mouth, and indeed, a couple of valid points have been raised. The reverting diff above is a particular concern, as it removed content being added to an article, it wasn't a simple case of adding back the speedy deletion tag, now we've got some over-zealous tagging going on already, people who go around whacking CSD tags on anything and everything, resulting in some articles with a lot of potential being deleted, but when the revert actually removes content, that's really not fair. I'm also noting that the article is still around, it really looks like no thought has been placed into adding the tag back onto the page, it was a simple revert and run. That sort of works (though it's really unhelpful behaviour and I wouldn't encourage anybody to behave like that) but when you're an administrator, delete and running isn't an option, careful consideration and research is necessary to determine if an article like that should be deleted, I would expect an administrator to spend a few minutes looking to see if such an article is determined to be notable under our notability criteria, check on the internet to see that it's not a hoax article and so on. The revert and run behaviour I'm seeing doesn't exactly inspire confidence you'll do that. Secondly, I'm less that impressed by the answer to question 4, it's tempting to have see a user on AIV, take a stroll over to an alleged vandals talk page, see if they've got a full set of warnings and block them, but sadly, naughty little people edit warring have been known to warn each other for vandalism, users suffering connection problem have been warned for vandalism and so on, and I'm not seeing any indication that there would be any review of the edits involved, it seems very clear cut how they would enact a block on an account, it's not always as easy out there on-wiki, there's an awful lot of bad faith being assumed out there, assuming malice is the order of the day and people are branded vandals completely unnecessarily. Likewise, sometimes an inactive account will return to life a year after they last edited, and will begin vandalising, sometimes they aren't warned (I don't warn vandals, and I know a great many others don't either, I see collecting vandalism warnings as building some sort of trophy cabinet, but that's personal philosophy for another day) yet there's no question the account knows they're misbehaving and no amount of warnings will stop them. Perhaps that's something you'll get the hang of as you become more experienced, but it's just something to be aware of. I'm not sure where this will end up towards the end of the RfA, there will no doubt be plenty of more questions and I think I'll wait until they have been asked and answered before deciding on how to comment.'''Oppose''' User does not seem to have a clear understanding of Wikipedia policies.'''Er....uh...I hate to do this, but dude I have to oppose''' - While I think ThinkBlue (:P) is a great user and have had wonderful enteractions with her in the past I just feel this RfA is a bit pre-mature. ThinkBlue has not shown enough participation in administrative areas to clearly demonstrate a understanding of policy, and it shows in her answers to the questions. There are a few questions that worry me the most, those being #4, #7, #10, #11,  and #12. They all show a lack of understanding of policy. Might I recommend that you wait a few months read up on some policies, work in admin related areas, and continue to do all the other great work you do then come back and pass your next RfA with flying colors. I will be happy to support in the future, and once again: Thank you for all of your hard work here. Best of luck,'''Oppose'''. Seemingly incorrect answers to questions #07, #08, #10 and the first bit of #11, which too isinsufficiently answered. Overall, you're a good editor, but this RfA seems way too early and rather rushed.'''Oppose''' Welcome your desire to contribute to Wikipedia.Please again later as per [[WP:NOTNOW]] Sorry and Good luck for the future.'''Oppose'''. I think the candidate is going to be a good admin someday, but unfortunately, today isn't that day. There's certainly no [[Heat death of the universe|deadline]], so plenty of time is available to you to expand some content, work on AIV and other areas, and generally show that you're capable of handling the admin tools. You're eager to help with DYK, and I urge you to do so - call it an apprenticeship, if you will. Once you've shown that you understand how these tasks are performed, I think many of my fellow opposers would find no further reason to oppose. It's an experience thing, and you should not be daunted at all because of it. I look forward to supporting you in the future. Best,'''Oppose''' per admin is a "team leader or manager" comment. Veers dangerously close to making an admin a [[WP:Very Big Deal]]. --'''Oppose'''. What I've seen of your work, I like. You're an excellent editor who's on the right track. However, you just don't quite have enough experience for my taste. You have less than 2000 edits (and it is very rare that an RFA pass for someone with sub-2000). You do a good job with images and with the mainspace, but you don't have enough experience in admin-related areas yet, with only 60 edits to the Wikipedia namespace. I see you used to have somewhat of a problem with edit summary usage, but I'm glad to see you rectified that. You'll probably want to wait 3 more months, with a total of 2000-3000 edits and a few hundred in the Wikipedia namespace. Then I think you'll be ready. Please also take a look at [[User:Useight/RFA Standards|my admin criteria]] for a sample of what some users expect in an admin candidate. A little more experience and I'll be glad to support. Feel free to contact me if you ever have any questions about anything.'''Support''' I see no issues that would warrant an oppose.

Questions 4 & 7 are most concerning, as others have said. 7 especially, because it shows a reluctance to talk it out with the other admin first. Hopefully, another RfA in six months or so will yield better results.'''Nope'''.  While I agree that time can fix some wounds with solid behavior, the diffs provided by Sandifer from a month ago where T-Tag called someone Pathetic among other things, does not instill confidence in my mind for how he will react when someone comes to his talk page with similar complaints as he's brought to others. I'm not saying the other editor was necessarily an angel, but two wrongs... Wikipedia is not a battleground.  Yes, you haven't been blocked in 6 months, no you haven't reformed enough since your last block to warrant adminship.

I don't think admins need substantive editing in 25 articles, but they should have at least ''one''.'''Sitting on the fence'''. While you seem to be an energetic and good person, and a definite asset to Wikipedia, I cannot give you a support !vote just due to your editing pattern. While I understand that real-life issues can deter one from editing, or facilitate it greatly (as can be seen in my own edit history), I'd like to see you keep up the pace. If this was April and your editing would be consistent, I'd definitely be willing to support though. Cheers,'''Support.''' Kind of a no-brainer, way more qualified than I was when I was promoted.Hate to be the first contributor to the miserable failure that Naerii predicted, but I'm afraid that you're just not ready.  Keep up your mainspace work, use edit summaries consistently, watch out for copyright violations, and respect different varieties of English.

Continue contributing to Wikipedia as a user, as the areas you mentioned you would like to work in do not require administrator access..'''Oppose'''. As the above have said, please change your signature and shorten your userpage, the latter almost crashed Firefox when I visited it. I'd recommend removing all the templates or moving things to subpages. Edit count also shows ~1k edits and instability in edit pattern (you came in March 07, became somewhat active in May, and disappeared until September) and admins need to show some sort of consistency - we don't want to give you the tools only to have you disappear in February but reappear in June. ''''''''per above''' Would also recommend gaining greater familiarity with [[Wikipedia:Dispute resolution]] processes.

I was going to abstain here, as I'm utterly unfamiliar with the area of the candidate's major contributions, but the editor's arguing with the Oppose votes has tipped me into joining them. I am uncomfortable giving the delete button to someone whose AfD work seems so slipshod.'''Oppose'''. CSDs just scare me (though candidate shows a willingness to learn, this should be fixed as a non-admin, not as an admin) and the fact that he responded to almost every single oppose... Personally, I'd prefer if the candidate just took the criticism as a place for improving instead of disagreeing with every single critic. Sorry, but best of luck to you in the future! <font color="777777">On the right track and no evidence of an inclination to abusing the mop.

Happy Wikying! <font face="Forte">It took me a while to think about this, but I'm going to have to oppose. I appreciate your enthusiasm and your efforts since your last RfA, but I'd like you to have more experience editing the mainspace and adding content before you become an admin. I know that a lot of people claim mainspace contributions aren't relevant to admin tasks, but I think they're key for instilling the kind of attitude I want an admin to have. I think that it's important for admins to have been involved in creating or improving articles so that they can understand how people feel when their articles get deleted, and hopefully they will have more respect for content. I just don't think it's possible to understand and act fairly towards people who mostly edit content if you have no experience of improving content yourself. Wikignomish tasks are important, I agree, but an admin should have been involved in at least the creation of one article or assisting with getting an article to GA. I'm also a little concerned that you take things that happen onwiki [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:VivioFateFan&diff=prev&oldid=181324479 a little too personally]. When I closed your last RFA I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:VivioFateFan&diff=prev&oldid=181292523 advised] you to wait a few months before renominating - not something you ''have'' to do, certainly, but I'd like you to have been around for a while longer before I trust you with the sysop tools. This is nothing against you, I just think that as we have plenty of admins at the moment we can afford to be picky about who we promote and I think I'd rather wait another two or three months before I feel I can support you. Please try getting involved in some content processes - getting articles to GA is fairly easy! Album articles are especially easy to improve.

Support because I believe the net effect of his adminship would be positive. Weak because although I disagree with DGG on what and what shouldn't be an article on Wikipedia, I trust and respect his judgement when it comes to trigger-happy people.

Careless tagging for speedy deletion can be and often is undone by responsible admins. Careless deletion usually isn't.'''Regretful oppose'''. I am persuaded particularly by [[User:DGG]] and [[User:Stifle]] that this contributor needs more time to fully grasp policies. This nom has good energy (and a good sense of humor!), and I think he does some great work for Wikipedia, but I can't support at this time in the face of evidence that the nom may not be as careful with CSD tags as he could be. CSDs are a big deal to me in evaluating RfAs, especially when the nom mentions specifically a desire to work in that area. Within the last month, we have these [[WP:CSD#A7]] tags which in my opinion (and those of the editors &/or admins who challenged or declined them) asserted notability at the time of tagging: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carrie_Feiner&oldid=199752496 1], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Empireonline.com&oldid=198236337 2], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Igor_Zerajic&oldid=198241999 3], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jane_McAdam_Freud&oldid=198251207 4], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polbo&direction=prev&oldid=197122790 5], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_P._Farrell&oldid=195980646 6], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leading_Edge_Group&oldid=195980909 7] & [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyberchump&oldid=196709459 8].

It's great to catch your own mistakes, but the other A7s indicate that the user is continuing to make them. An assertion of significance or importance is, of course, much less rigorous than [[WP:V|verification]] of [[WP:N|notability]]. Since speedy deletions may go unchallenged unless the creators are able to understand [[WP:DRV]] procedures (and many of them can't even figure out who deleted their articles), I can't comfortably support somebody whose contributions suggest that they may be overzealous in flushing articles. If this nom does not get the tools, I hope he will continue new page patrol, since I believe he is a very valuable contributor there, but also slow down to consider more fully whether or not an article asserts significance/importance. If he does get the tools, I hope that he will be particularly careful not to delete A7s unless he is ''quite sure'' that the article qualifies. This seems to be an area where, with or without tools, he needs a bit more work. Given everything else I see from this nom, I ''am'' sorry I can't support. If this RfA is not successful (at the moment it seems it probably will), I hope to be in the top section next time. --'''Oppose''' We do not need administrators who mis-apply speedy deletion criteria.'''Oppose'''.

Good luck.'''STRONG SUPPORT''' - [[Image:Squeaks Gatito Tigre.jpg|thumb|right|100px]] I looked over the candidate, as I always do. Then I read over the votes, as I always do.

An admin with a sense of humor? *GASP*... DO NOT WANT *facepalm* The [[WP:NBD]] is outdated and an epic ridiculous reason to oppose. There's a fundamental difference in opinion by many people on the big deal status of adminship. Anyone who clearly understands what adminship is the the potential damage a careless admin can cause at this stage in the project knows that adminship is, in fact, a big deal. That and the fact that you're basically elected for life. Backlogs need help, candidate has been on the project for a great deal of time. Has gained experience, as he pointing out in his nom statement before the dreaded cat pic (O NOES), and we can't expect every admin to start out knowing it all on day one. Do his contribs give the indication that he may abuse the tools? No. Is it reasonable to AGF on this one that he can be trusted? Yes. Do we need anymore stuffy, unfunny admins bringing down the morale of this place? Hell no. Clearly this project is losing its sense of humor. That's tragic.'''Oppose''' - the tone of the nomination doesn't sound like you are taking this seriously. --'''Neutral''' - Provisional only. I am not sure; you seem like one of those candidates that wanders aimlessly into RfA expecting to get through by accepting every point thrown at you. I would have to see some strong evidence of admin-related activites with good community interaction and an excellent track in most aspects of what is needed in an admin. That cat is off-putting at the moment, not because of what it is, but rather what it represents.'''Support''' - thought you were one already.

In spite of his nasty and unjustified attempt to get me kicked off Wikipedia (attempt, not person), this user has generally changed in an extraordinary way since the early days when I knew him around the paranormal articles.  He has become a much more neutral editor, and he has stopped being a discordant influence.  He has apparently been doing good work at Homeopathy (where in his early days he would have been a disruptor and sower of contention).  I have no reason to believe he would abuse the tools, and some reason to believe his is now a good editor.  ——''''''Wait, you're not an admin?''' I mean, I even have JavaScript that tells me who's an admin, and I still thought you were one. I guess you seemed so admin-like that I assumed you were one and forgot to check.'''Support''', a belated why-the-hell-did-nobody-tell-me support. [[User:TimVickers|Tim Vickers]] ([[User talk:TimVickers|talk]]) 05:45, 18 January 2008 (UTC)''''''''Oppose''' - I decided to actually take the time to go back over the last year and look at his comments, especially in admin-type disputes. Wikidudeman skirts dangerously close to POV-pushing in many disputes and on many talk pages, although he is good at cloaking his intentions and at "slow reverts." Having seen how dangerous it is to give admin tools to POV-pushers, I don't think the community should take a chance here.'''Oppose''' I've changed my vote (at this late date), having read the other "oppose" comments and looking more closely at some recent and past discussions involving Wikidudeman. I hadn't realised just how many discussions on subjects dealing with race have included his dubious involvement. As I mentioned in my "neutral" comment, I'm skeptical about his judgement, but I have two new points that have persuaded me to change my vote. The lesser point is that, in mentioning conflicts he had been involved in, Wikidudeman only cited the AAVE conflict, and not any others - not even quite recent/ongoing conflicts, leaving the impression that such events were well in the past. The more disturbing point is a profound contradiction: that Wikidudeman has worked strenuously over more than a year to restrict the inclusion of parapsychology, homeopathy and other pseudo-science content in Wikipedia (an orientation I can agree with), while at the same time working quite strenuously to include content from racist and deeply misguided sources as though they are on an equal footing with authoritative sources. Surely any "information" from ''Stormfront'' is of far less value to Wikipedia than the work of most homeopathy advocates... (The views of ''Stormfront'' have absolutely no relevance to the question of the ethnicity of the ancient Egyptians, for example.) Reviewing the David Irving discussions was both a reminder of the wretched AAVE saga, and a further confirmation that Wikidudeman doesn't or won't understand NPOV and its bearing on different kinds of sources. I still believe he is a much improved editor, but I can't believe that someone with such faulty judgement and perception would be a good administrator.'''Oppose''' per above.  Legitimate concerns have been raised.  There's no way he should be promoted this way, regardless of the vote count.'''Support''' Fantastic editor, knows what he's doing! I have no doubts he will make one of the best admins on wikipedia today. ''''''Strong Support''' I have known Wisdom for a while, and I have seen his tireless contributions. I actually thought Wisdom was already an admin for some reason, probably because of how well he has done here. I think that Wisdom will be a great user to give the tools to. Support!--'''Support''' I'm more than positive Wisdom is ready for the tools. He understand all the policies well, and has done a good amount of both article and vandalism work since his time here. He has a massive 602 reports to [[WP:UAA]] so I know he will definitely be an active member there. He also has 247 reports to [[WP:AIV]] which both show experience in two key admin areas. In the articlespace, Wisdom has helped make [[Rush (band)]] a featured article, and [[Neil Peart]] a [[WP:GA|good article]]. He has been contributing since 2006, which is enough experience, and has maintained perfect edit summary usage since November 2007. I'm sure he will make a great administrator. <span style="border:1px solid brown;padding:1px;">'''Support''' Your not an admin already?

''''''Weak Support''' I mainly agree with nom, but Ryan brings up valid concerns.I've been expecting this RfA for the past few weeks, so I'm not really surprised it's here.  I'm afraid I don't trust your judgment enough to support you.  Loosely based on the items mentioned above (although those are points of interest, and I wouldn't give them as much weight as Ryan and Al tally have), and per a recent encounter regarding [[WP:ACC|the account creation team and process]], I'd have to oppose, as I don't feel the least bit comfortable with the idea of you as an administrator.  It would appear that this RfA is off to a great start - as a result of that, if this should pass, I strongly urge and ask that you listen to the concerns brought to your attention, whether they be now, during this RfA, or after if you do become an administrator. -'''Oppose''' per Ryan. I think you should probably understand the consensus reasoning behind UAA better before being granted the ability to block users for violations. Or, indeed, try to get the consensus changed if you feel it needs to be. Sorry. <span style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; color:navy;">'''[&nbsp;As far as I'm concerned an editor's suitability for the sysop bit is simple to determine. It's about trust.

Using an automated rollback tool to label an edit as vandalism &ndash; when that edit had a clear edit summary explaining reasoning and did not otherwise appear to be vandalism &ndash; and writing it off as 'collateral damage'...just ain't right.

When not reverting, Citicat helps delete content at AfD. While such edits are important, they do not provide enough broad experience to deal with the admin tools.  Citicat has had many user talk page posts.

I trust Ryan's judgment and know that if he trains someone via admin coaching, they've been taught well. I've had contact with CP on IRC, and found him quite helpful (cloak issues, general IRC commands questions, etc, completely non-Wiki related items). While I do understand R's concern, I happen to feel that IRC actions and behavior should be left at the Wikipedia door. I've seen many an editor act quite differently on IRC than they do here, and to me, it doesn't seem to be an issue. What matters to me, is how an editor conducts themselves within ''this'' project. Cremepuff went through the adopt-a-user program, and I'm sure during that time, many of the initial concerns were addressed, and cleared up. I don't really think that not having major article building experience is a reason to oppose, although I would strongly encourage Creampuff to do some work in this area, as without realizing it, a number of policies and guideline subtleties are learned via writing, and building up articles. However, there is certainly room and need for good, solid vandal fighters, and they fill a vital role. As an administrator, I'm sure that CP would stay within his areas of familiarity until gaining more experience and knowledge of the other areas, and I have absolutely no doubt that he would request assistance and advice, when delving into areas he was unfamiliar with. His reply to question 7 shows he respects the actions of other administrators, and would seek council if he disagreed. I'll just urge CP to make use of the resources here, the new admin school, the council of experienced admins and editors, and take it slowly at first (which is, of course, good advice for all new admins). But I feel that Cremepuff would make a fine addition to the administrative team. <small>'''Support''' - He has an extensive article writing history.

I still have reservations about interpretation of deletion criteria but I don't fear a misuse of the tools after his additional statements on closing AfDs.

His signature pops up everywhere, it seems. :)Experienced, reasonable and civil. Actually, has had enough experience a year ago.'''Support''' Having run into the nom at various points of the project and having been favorably impressed when I've done so, I was a bit taken aback to find opposes placed here by editors whose opinions I very much respect. Because of that, I've spent considerable time examining his contributions just to be sure that I could stand by my impression, and I've come away convinced. While I can certainly agree with the opposers that it would be more beneficial to discuss what ''kinds'' of google hits are coming up in AfDs, by the nom's own statements ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joey Rodríguez|here]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Asharid-apal-Ekur|here]]) he seems to understand the challenges of using Google to confirm or deny notability in AfDs. Moreover, I like the evidence I see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Divaldo Pereira Franco|here]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/New relationship energy|here]] that he is not only putting some thought into his AfD opinions, but monitoring the conversations and re-evaluating based on later input. I do not agree with every opinion he has ever put forth at an AfD, but I respect his familiarity with policy and his obvious desire to work towards consensus. With respect specifically to [[User:DGG|DGG]]'s impression that "Next time I'll consult with someone more knowledgeable before bringing a Russian pol here" may be an admission of lack of familiarity with policy, I interpret the nom's statement to admit lack of familiarity rather with Russian ''politics''. [[WP:BIO]] ''does'' indicate that "Just being an elected local official, or an unelected candidate for political office, does not guarantee notability, although such a person may be notable for other reasons besides their political careers alone". His decision to bring the subject to AfD rather than nominate it for PROD suggests an awareness that wider review might be beneficial, and assertions of notability in the article [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Farid_Babayev&oldid=173097307 as he found it] and in [http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSL2147085720071121 the source provided] are slim enough that his uncertainty about notability seems understandable. (That said, in such a case I might suggest tagging notability concerns and broaching the subject on the talk page of the article or a related wikiproject. But I'm ''not'' naturally [[WP:BOLD|bold]], and, even there, what I see suggests to me familiarity with policy & desire to seek consensus.) I do not believe the nom would misuse the tools, through willfulness or lack of awareness, but feel pretty confident that he would continue as he seems accustomed to do in working devotedly and cooperatively to improve the encyclopedia. I would, however, second [[User:Dorftrottel|Dorftrottel]]'s suggestion that he drop the smiley from his sig. I love emoticons, but fear using them automatically can lead an admin to trouble. :) Not too long ago, I got a very irate note from an editor who felt my use of the language from [[:Template:Nothanks-web]] was condescending. A lot of admin work leads to ruffled feathers, and minimizing those = a good thing. --'''Support''' Good answers, looks like a good editor likely to be equally as good with admin tools. --'''Support''' evidently I should pay more attention; Tim's nominating all the cool people :)'''Support'''.

I'm confident, though, that DO11 can be trusted to exercise proper caution in using tools that may be unfamiliar. —'''Support''' Looks good to me. Could have cooled things a little more in the discussion highlighted by Majorly, but generally did well. I really think that the [[WP:FUCK]] issue has been blown a little out of proportion, and the fact that the user identifies with it encourages me, and shows a greater level of maturity IMHO. I would normally err on the side of oppose if there are maturity concerns, but I am happy to take the chance here.'''Support'''. That spat with [[User:Cynehelm]] probably could have been handled a bit better, but really it didn't seem to be going anywhere at all without intervention. The WP:FUCK essay bothers me not, although I would advise that message to stay off the candidate's talk page, and possibly that he remove the "DGAF" userbox from his user page as well - it still might be misleading to a new editor looking for help. Other than that, no problems. <font face="Trebuchet MS">- '''Zeibura S. Kathau''' <sup>('''Support.''' per nom.

Probably needs a little more tempering...'''Neutral''' I read the essay on Don't Give a F**k, and while the philosophy is ok the use of language is immature. I will not oppose, as I think that this editor has real potential, but on the basis of perceived immaturity I cannot support at this time.--While the FUCK essay has a good message overall, I am somewhat concerned about how the candidate applies it.  --<s>'''Support''' - but could do with a few more edits.'''Support''' - having become involved in the attempts to unprotect and improve the [[Battle of Washita River]] article myself, I can echo Yksin's praises of Dreadstar's conduct, approach, and civility there. Everything I've seen from him makes me confident he has a thorough grasp of WP policies and will apply them fairly and use any new responsibilities wisely. --'''Support''' Dreadstar has often helped me in difficult editing situations by giving advice and pointing me to specific policies. I've been impressed with his dedication to Wikipedia and learned a LOT from the way he handled the major rewrite of [[What the Bleep]] -- an article that had  long been contentious and had serious violations of WP:NOR.'''Support'''.  Editor has been involved in many highly complex and contentious issues on Wikipedia, and these have lent themselves to mis-interpretation here.  But being so involved or even making mistakes is not a good reason to oppose his candidacy.  He seems to be a conscientious and thoughtful editor who is already doing many of the things which admins do.  I think he will do well. ——''''''Support''' User track appears to be okay and to come back after surgery and contribute to wikipedia is great.'''Support''' I am not convinced by those editors who have brought up concerns. The majority of these issues are months old; some dating back to 2006, most from the first quarter of 2007. In nearly every unsuccessful RfA, the candidates are advised to "return in 3-4 months" to demonstrate they have learned from the issues in question, and have properly changed the way they deal with them. I am confident that Dreadstar has done just that, and I believe this is best illustrated in his answers to the many questions asked here; his measured and thoughtful responses show he is more than able to retain a cool head. I have bumped into him many times during Recent Changes patrol, and I have never once noticed he acted in anything but a polite manner, his notices and responses even and calm, and his explanations thorough. His assistance to me when I have questions have been invaluable, and while I consider him a "friend", I did some serious looking at this RfA, before deciding to comment. I respect Wikidudeman greatly, and his concerns caused me to pause for quite some time, while I looked into Dreadstar's past history. I respect Wikidudeman for abstaining from comment now, as Dreadstar has agreed to be open to recall. The sockpuppet issue going on here with Deedstar and his multiples is very disturbing, but I would request that the closing administrators take the comments made by those editors with very little weight. There are editors I respect who have voiced opposition, and I gave their comments heavy weight in my final decision, but I again noticed that nearly every major issue brought up was over 6 months old. I believe in giving second chances, and I fully believe that everyone can learn from past mistakes. As far as the "paranormal" stuff goes in general, I honestly have no feelings about the paranormal articles. It does seems to me that there are a good many articles on subjects that are either known to not be true, or just suspected as such. The point is that if they are presented as items which were reported by the media, and strive to not offer any opinion, I see no reason these articles cannot co-exist with other aspects of the encyclopedia. I agree that in the past, Dreadstar may have used edit summaries that were not overly helpful, and that he has made mistakes in the past, but there is not one of us who can say we haven't. I truly believe that Dreadstar has not only learned a significant amount from these long-past incidents, but also since then, and I'm more than sure he's also learned quite a bit during the course of what can only be described as a difficult RfA process here. I truly think that Dreadstar would be responsible, cautious, and if faced with a situation he felt could be difficult for him, he would request assistance or request another administrator handle it. Therefore, it is my opinion that despite the controversies brought up, it will be beneficial to the community to allow Dreadstar to assist Wikipedia in administrative duties. <sup>'''Oppose''' the edits flagged by Wikidudeman are troubling. The candidate's response to question 1 indicates that s/he intends to use the tools for vandalism fighting, but the flagged interactions seem to indicate that s/he doesn't know how to tell vandalism from strenuous debate. I also fear that s/he has a rather thin skin which is not a good quality for an admin: we have to endure sometimes quite nasty comments and second-guessing with civility and some good humor.  Perhaps the most troubling of the edits is the deletion on discussion page; what struck me was that it wasn't deleted in the heat of the debate but 3 weeks later. I cannot exactly put my finger on why this troubles me so much - is it evidence of harboring a grudge? or having to have the last word? or deleting something unsavory after people are noticing it are no longer paying attention because the debate has moved on? I don't know but it to me is really troublesome and none of the simple explanations is good. I really fear that giving him/her the tools will ultimately spawn an RFARB to take them away.'''Protest support''' This RfA is going to fail but I'm banging my head against the wall when I read ''some'' of the opposes. I'd like to point out that a stated urgent need for the tools or a promise to be very active with them is certainly not a prerequisite for adminship. As has been said many times before, an admin who deletes one speedy candidate a day is still having a positive impact and since we're not desysoping admins whose activity is low I don't see why we should ask of future admins to be deleting, protecting, blocking and whatnot 24/7. Anyone who has the admin buttons knows that things like viewing deleted histories can help one make better, quicker decisions on various things and if an editor who is actively seeking to help the project can become more effective, then the whole project benefits. I don't think many admins could honestly say that the use they found for the tools matches exactly what they had in mind when they first applied. This doesn't matter: if you're a responsible editor, you'll use them responsibly for the good of the project. I feel DrKiernan is being treated unfairly and that some are failing to assume good faith: he tries to demonstrate his commitment to the project by pointing out his FA participation and this becomes "oppose, adminship is not a badge". Say what? He says "I won't be active because I still want to have time to do my usual editing" and this becomes "he doesn't care about admin duties and has no vision". The result is that the RfA will fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the candidate's capabilities and everything to do with him not jumping through the right hoops. In the end, we pass on a qualified candidate. How constructive.'''Changing from Oppose to Support''' Who cares if they rarely use the tools? One vandal blocked in one week is one less vandal.

I think Elonka is a good and valuable editor who shouldn't be an administrator.'''Oppose'''. As others have said, a valuable contributor, but one where the project would problably be better off if she isn't an admin. I don't doubt her intentions, but she just causes, contributes to, or increases too much drama. Based on her life experience and positions, she should be much better at conflict resolution, but instead she tends to increase and/or draw conflicts. From observation of her interactions, I can only come to the conclusion that this will increase if she were to be an admin. Others have pointed out her problem behavior and some have noted it's in the past, but I don't think there has been time enough to change. People do change, but in my experience not many people do, and certainly not very quickly. Not having the tools won't keep her from being able to be a valuable contributor, in fact it will probably help in that regard, and thus Wikipedia will be better off if she remains an editor without the tools.

''''''Support''', with a few words to agree in large part with [[User:Friday|Friday]], infra.  My thinking about IRC is not, I think, dissimilar from that of Friday, and were I convinced that GD intended to advance, the apparent views of the community to the contrary notwithstanding, a conception of IRC as an appropriate venue at which to undertake broad discussions and make specific decisions relative to on-wiki adminstrative activities, I would probably !vote ''neutral'' or ''oppose''; the IRC issue doesn't, though, seem really to be one of any great significance here, and I don't see the candidate as likely to act against consensus or inconsistent with established practice or policy.  Neither do I think it entirely unreasonable to oppose a candidate in view of his expressions of policy preferences (even if he makes such expressions entirely decorously and commits himself to comporting his editing, etc., with policy), as I imagine there to be some views the very advancing of which is prima facie evidence of one's non-fitness for adminship (I don't know that I would view any expressions thusly, but I don't think it inappropriate for others to view certain purportedly extreme expressions in that fashion; we have seen opposes on certain RfAs on the grounds that a candidate generally disfavored BLP, even as it was unquestioned that he/she would apply BLP consistent with the spirit putatively situated thereunder, and although I think those opposes to have been altogether wrong-headed, I don't think them to have been wholly unreasonable).  The instant candidate appears, though, to be possessed of a civil demeanor, a deliberative temperament, and a sound sense of judgment, demonstrated not least by his expressed narrow construction of [[WP:IAR|IAR]], for which construction a consensus of the community exists and the application of which construction demonstrates an appreciation of the proper role of consensus in a collaborative project such as ours, such that I think one might conclude with a good degree of confidence that [[User:Jahiegel/Views on Wikipedia/Requests for adminship|the net effect on the project of the candidate's being sysop(p)ed should be positive]].'''Oppose'''.

He then followed that by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=138980175 urging] an editor to take a COI complaint with COFS to the community sanction noticeboard, leading to a no-resolution there and to an long, time-consuming [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/COFS|arbitration]] that basically did the work that the [[WP:COIN]] could have done in the first place (IMO). So why am I supporting him? To be honest, I think I saw Jehochman mature over the course of that arbitration and realize that issues are sometimes (often?) more complex than they at first seem. Jehochman has shown a willingness to understand and address difficult issues that can only help the project. I am concerned a bit about what might be an exclusionary attitude, his use of "we" in instances like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&diff=159682558&oldid=159666517 this] to denote what I presume to be "THE ADMINS", of which I know that he wants to be a part. I think he will learn that admins put their pants on one pixel at a time just like the rest of us and I sincerely hope that he does not harbor any ideas that THE ADMINS are somehow superior to us "regular" editors or that wikipedia is divided into WE, THE ADMINS and "the rest". That would be unfortunate. I am, however, inclined to give him the chance he wants. --'''Support''' per convincing reasons given by supporters; not convinced by opposers.

Any accusations of pro-Hugo Chavez edits by Jersey below (based on his removal of one un-sourced edit 18 months ago) should be taken with a large pinch of salt. Sandy simply has a point of view on Latin America so forthright it could make a [[Contra]] blush ;) Next we'll be haranguing MONGO for his clear Anti-American bias!--'''Support''' looks like another stellar candidate.

I'm confident that this is a good self-nomination.'''Support.''' Although the opposers have given excellent reasons why this candidate should not be elected presient of the United States, I am completely unconvinced that Jody will be a bad admin, especially after looking through contributions. Several reasons have been given opposing this candidate, none of which really provide a creditable reason why we as a community could expect this candidate to abuse the tools. With all due respect to those opposing, among whom are great and wise editors, the reasons for opposing this nomination are among the weakest and most questionable I have ever seen. To those who say "We can't vote for someone who ''wants'' to be an admin," who the hell are we giving the tools to?

Her willingness to improve articles that are brought to GAR shows that she is committed to building the encyclopedia, unlike some admins who are only interested in people politics. During my two discussions with her, which are among my few pleasant experiences on IRC, she gave me several useful pointers regarding an article I am planning to improve to GA status. This is also, to a certain extent, a protest support, as I find that the oppose votes are ridiculous - either prompted by LaraLove's allegedly "ageist" comment or motivated by GA-bashing. Although I am 16, and strongly oppose ageism, I do not find LaraLove's allegedly "ageist" comment particularly troubling.  Opposing a candidate on the grounds that he is 12 is one thing; showing evidence of the candidate's immaturity, and mentioning the candidate's age in passing, is another. Oh, and have a nice day. --In my singular interaction with this user she seemed to have adopted an "us vs. them" attitude which was damaging to the discussion, to say nothing of the fact that this attitude misrepresented the reality of the situation. Some relevant diffs: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Good_articles&diff=155018048&oldid=155012460],  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Good_articles&diff=154333218&oldid=154255008], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Good_articles&diff=153228953&oldid=153135661]. I'm happy to be told why the impression I have of this editor's attitude is incorrect.The GA process is fundamentally detrimental to the encyclopedia. It's very, very dangerous, and essentially consists of people giving a spurious air of legitimacy to (often appalling and POV) articles when they have '''no''' competence to deliver a meaningful review. I am uncomfortable with the judgment of ''any'' editor that spends so much time around this process. How many GA catastrophes have we had recently? People arranging to pass each other's articles on IRC, stuff that might have been written by the National Ministry of Propaganda being smiled through the system...awful stuff.'''Oppose''' I've just spent half an hour going through Lara's comments throughout this RfA and on talk pages, [[WT:RFA]], her talk page et. al. .

This oppose is pointless due to the weight of support, but I'm making it none the less. Please don't ask for diff's - I find it self-evident through perusal of comments.

Likewise, there seems to be a lot more article-editing going on than with many admins (compare her last 1000 edits to [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Ais523|mine when I ran for adminship]], for instance); I don't take article-editing into account when deciding on RfA opinions, unless it shows misunderstandings of policy, but it appears to be better than many other users' and I don't understand why the candidate is being opposed for it. One major risk with inexperience in an admin candidate is misusing the tools and screwing everything up, but I don't think there's much of a risk of that based on the track record. (Oh, and my usual caution to [[WP:ACC]] regulars who run for adminship: you need to make a non-admin alternate account to go on checking username similarity, as if an admin tries to create a username it succeeds even if a similar username exists.

I'm not going to oppose someone who seems to be a trusted user - we need more admins - but I have several misgivings that keep me from supporting.  (1) the diff provided by Zleitzen - profanities in edit summaries are unhelpful and civility at all times is important. (2) frequent use of the word "[[cruft]]" - this word is one that should be stricken from our vocabulary on Wikipedia.  Sometimes, a topic is not appropriate for inclusion on Wikipedia because it has little significance outside of the fictional universe in which it exists, but that doesn't mean that it isn't important to someone.  Referring to things that are important to someone as "[[cruft]]" can be offensive.  You are taking what is important to them and calling it "useless junk or excess materials".  Nothing good can come from edit summaries like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2007_January_18&diff=prev&oldid=101582215], for example.

This thread dealt with an editor who's post-arbitration and who (although he has problems of his own) had also been trolled by a sneaky vandal and a returning sockpuppet of a banned editor for most of his time as a Wikipedian.  It's touch-and-go to see whether this person will adapt to site standards and succeed as an editor.  One of the most important things we can do right now is to set the right example regarding [[WP:NOT#Not a battleground]] so that maybe he'll come around.  I have some concerns about giving the mop to someone who steps in with remarks that don't move the situation forward and could be read as flippant.

But I am mildly nauseated by the number of co-noms, the supporters that support him only because he makes comments at rfa (although I do agree he that he does do his work when he comments), and the general bonhomie, desk-thumping and back-patting orgy that we seem to be having here. This is not some popularity contest. There is already a trend at RfA to blindly ''vote'' when there is a good set of nominators, with the reasoning "If such good nominators found him suitable for the job, he must be." We don't need any more of that silliness. Anyway, none of this is Pedro's fault; it's the others should have more sense. I'd be surprised if more than half of the supporters of this RfA actually go through Pedro's contributions instead of just "running into him often at RfA" or  seeing "his name pop up all over the place" or better yet "I trust the nominators". - [[User:Twooars|<font color="Indigo">'''Two'''</font>]][[User_Talk:Twooars|<font color="DarkViolet">'''Oars'''</font>]]'''Strong Support''' How are you not already an admin?

I've tried to tell you a number of times before that you need to broaden your editing if you wanted to go for adminship. I'd suggest you may even stop your job as a clerk for a while and branch out.

It's been a long time since I've seen so many comments in opposition to a candidate being so mis-aligned with the goal of building an encyclopedia. Luckily most people relied on core issues. This candidate has years of edit history to look at wether he is trustworthy enough. Not only that, but he explained why he was not going to answer the questions. Kudos to Ragesoss for not giving in to such hoop jumpery. -'''Sincere Support''' (changed from oppose) Although answering the questions would have provided a standard form of information, this candidate is trustworthy and has been doing a good job. Additionally, I am satisfied with the candidate's self-nom statement.--<strong><font style="color: #082567">[[User:Husond|Hús]]</font>'''Support'''. I felt the same as Xoloz, but then I asked myself why do we call these questions optional if they're not?'''Strong oppose''' per using one's personal RfA as a platform for reforming RfA. How is this relevant to adminship? Well, for one thing, admins should generally follow established processes. Also, given the lack of answers to the questions, my ability to evaluate the candidate is somewhat restricted. I will ''never'' support a user whom I haven't or can't fully evaluate, and in this case, the restriction is caused by the candidate himself. The "strong" part of my oppose comes from this: the candidate has been indirectly asked to answer the questions (see the comments above), yet still has not done so. If the issue was the "indirect" manner of the requests, then I'll do it directly: please consider the questions as if I (or some other editor) has posted them and answer them. I don't exactly have a problem with candidates who don't answer the optional questions. I ''do'' have a problem with candidates who don't answer questions from editors.

The former will allow for (as stated) exceptions, in case one is needed, and the latter can allow for human review, and help in situations where retargeting is more appropriate than deletion.

An admin should at least spend the time it takes to read the redirect to decide if maybe there's some other action to take...maybe the redirect should be retargeted, or maybe there should be an article there...or maybe in some cases the target does need an article after all (depending on why the target was deleted if that's why the redirect is broken)...whatever, a final pair of eyes is needed. I'm also worried about a general increase in acceptance of bot deletions for the same reasons, don't want to see this become a precedent for other requests of this kind. I don't want this to go through just because of a general enthusiasm for technology. Unless there's a compelling reason to keep the broken redirect backlog clear I don't see why we need this. And just a quick comment, I certainly trust the developer(s) and operators....it's not an issue of the bot going sideways or anything.'''Neutral''' (leaning to support) While I have 200% confidence in this bot not screwing up anything and with the absolute trust in the operator and coder, I stand by the fact that one edit can totally rip off a new contributor's editing career here.  All newbies are different in their own aspect, and we might get one who likes to fix ''broken'' or ''double'' redirects.

He did come across as harsh when talking about dealing with vandals in general; however, he has stated that he may have come across harsher than he means to be and I think he may have accidentally given us that impression.

Some people might take offense but there's hardly any topic that's free of controversy. More importantly, I don't believe that it's desirable (let alone feasible) to demand that admins hold no opinions or restrict themselves to non-controversial issues. Administrators, just like editors, are first and foremost people. We can't ask editors to check their opinions at the door when they become admins. In my humble opinion, all we can ask of an admin is to not let his or her beliefs dictate his decisions and I have seen no evidence whatsoever to indicate that this could be a problem in this case. --'''Zero Sum Support''' Just here to cancel out the "boo-hoo I don't like his user boxes" crowd.'''Support''' - Well I thought you were already an Admin..Good Editor..--<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:small;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;">'''Support''' - as per the others above, I do dislike those (now vanished) userboxes, but I've never had any problem with him as an editor.

He doesn't want the attention or love from another RFA - Walton really does believe all this democratic business. Personally, I disagree with Walton on quite a lot of stuff - but he's not an abusive admin or a troll, or anything foolish - he will not do harm. Was a person we need, still is.

Well, you said that you'd run another RfA if any editor requested it, and your defence has been since then that you are a man of your word and hence this RfA. So it looks like I'm not a man of my word. However on balance I strongly believe that you regaining the tools will be a massive positive for Wikipedia (per my question above). It means that I have to look a bit stupid and indecisive, but I must go back on my word for the good of the project. (This RfA is close now, and every support counts, so I'm not blowing myself up here - honest!). I still dislike reconfirmation RfA's, but the benefit to the project of you getting the bit back is far far bigger than my personal likes or dislikes.

On the one hand, I can sympathise with some of Spawn Man's concerns below; in particular, with regards to Q1, although I understand what the candidate is trying to say, it would be better for him to list specific admin areas in which he would work, just so we can be certain that he understands the role of an administrator and would be capable of working effectively in the areas in which he plans to be active. However, I don't think this is a sufficient reason to oppose.

I like the answers he gave to the questions, personally. Furthermore, one of the knocks against him seems to be his vague responses when asked what he would do with the tools - maybe I'm alone here, but I like a prospective admin who isn't eager to dive right in and involve him or herself in blocking, protecting, deleting, etc. I'd be much more worried if he seemed over-anxious to get the tools.

Reverting with "See talk, I pretty much blew up your argument" is no way to find consensus. I'm also concerned that it's hard to examine his contributions, because many of his edits contain nothing more than an automatic edit summary (and I'm not counting repetitive fair use edits).

I am non-neglibly concerned, though, about his replies to questions 5 and 5a, from which I apprehend an inclination to [[WP:IAR|IAR]] a bit too freely qua admin (one's IARing qua editor, and one's acting generally in whatever fashion he might think to be beneficial to the encyclopedia [even where consistent with ''Foundation directives''], is quite fine, but when one acts as an admin, he acts only ministerially [and, for what it's worth, as well, as, I guess, in any other situation, acts outside of policy only where it is quite plain that there is an overwhelming consensus for such summary action (not, that is, only where one thinks there ''should'' be such a consensus)], to determine for what courses of action exists the support of the community and then to act to carry out those courses of action), which quality is the most pernicious, unfortunately, one can find in an admin.  Even, then, as his AK's conduct has given no grand hint of his being likely to rely untowardly on IAR (although his submission that [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/American Airlines destinations/archive]] ought to have been closed as ''delete'' strikes me as perhaps consistent with what I might perceive as overreach), I must, with regret, say that I can't conclude with sufficiently great confidence that the [[User:Jahiegel/Views on Wikipedia/Requests for adminship|net effect of the project of AK's being sysopped should be positive]].'''Support'''.

Though I don't agree with everything that Budgiekiller has said in reply to my question, I am willing to lend my support.

Finally, I feel that playing [[Whac-A-Mole]] with ip vandals isn't necessarily good practice for the sort of non-vandalism disputes that admins have to deal with. This a candidate who should have been asked the ''blocking established contributors'' and ''punitive block'' questions.'''Oppose''' Although I have had interactions with Bushcarrot and he seems to be a nice guy, the fact that he told the nominator of Esperenza's deletion to "go fuck themselves" (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Esperanza&diff=prev&oldid=97194596 here]) leads me to oppose.

Hard-working wiki-gnome -- just needs to expand his work to something more content-intensive.'''Oppose''' According to Q1, Captain panda wishes to help with [[CAT:CSD]]. Judging from this user's contributions, I see that this user tags articles for [[WP:CSD#A7|CSD A7]] when assertions of notability have been made. The user also is a bit hasty on his speedy tagging. For example, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wendy_Costa&diff=139582901&oldid=139582777 here], Captain panda tags an article for CSD A7 when an assertion of notability has been made. That article can be deleted later by PROD or AfD, but not by speedy deletion since it doesn't qualify. I see the same issue [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ohene&diff=139999990&oldid=139999800 here]. An assertion of notability has been made in the article. Also, the two previous diffs show that user is a bit too "trigger-happy" since he tags articles within 1-2 minutes of creation (some more can be seen [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nottingham_University_Boat_Club&diff=139100036&oldid=139099878] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nottingham_University_Boat_Club&diff=139100036&oldid=139099878]). People frequently create a rough outline of an article, and continue to work on it while it is in the mainspace. It's good that you re-checked your tagging [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kebert_Xela_%28disambiguation%29&diff=prev&oldid=139574130 here], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unsurpassed_Masters&diff=128416727&oldid=128416656 here] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pitzhanger_Manor_House&diff=124485906&oldid=124485103 here], but I still think you should be more careful and not so hasty in tagging. Also, I think you shouldn't spend so much time in RfAs. That time can easily be managed into article work. By the way, keep up the good work with the assessment drive. <span style="background:#E0FFFF;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;">I am concerned about this users' experience in relation to the ''encyclopedia'', and also the candidates' communication skills. '''Sad '''oppose'''. I think many of your ideas and approaches to consensus are quite correct, but for a person who spends a lot of time tagging articles and evaluating them, I think some experience in actually writing some encyclopedic content is important for perspective. This perspective is important when it comes to evaluating whether to send something to AFD or PROD, or whether to speedy delete something. It is important when giving advice to newcomers, who ask you why you deleted something they created. There are cases of good admins who have a fairly limited amount of experience in article writing, BigDT comes to mind, but those cases are exceptional. I don't think that being a prolific contributor who makes featured articles is necessary, but some experience in learning how to source things, look for sources, evaluate the material, and write something comprehensible will be useful to you, as well as being fun and educational. With all that said, I think your heart is in the right place, you have a good attitude, and I think you have done some good stuff. Good luck for the future.'''Support'''. The responsibilities of adminship relate to maintenance and (to an extent) enforcement, not article-writing. He may not be an active article-writer, but he clearly understands the deletion policy (as demonstrated by innumerable correct speedy tags and AfD comments), and is an active vandal-fighter (which demonstrates a clear need for the tools). There is no need for him to get involved in BLP as an administrator; I had very little involvement in that area during my 7 months as a sysop, for instance. He is more than ready to be given the tools.'''Support'''. An active user who will help clean things up.'''Oppose''' per Ral315.  Clear misunderstanding of the finer points of policy is demonstrated at the answer to Question 10.  From my familiarity with the editor, I also am concerned about his communication skills.'''Oppose''' per Everyking. Not enough work on content. The sppedy assessment drive is also a major cause for concern. --'''Oppose''' per Sandy and Xolox and Woodym555. Inexperience in general, especially its restricted/non-diverse nature. Not a wide-enough perspective with which to make the complex decisions the admin tools typically require. --'''Neutral''' I'm not feeling entirely comfortable with the answer to Q1 that the user will spend most of his time in "Wikipedia's deletion areas". --'''SUPPORT''' Has FA. Sometimes, one must look past mere numbers to quality and ability.

After reviewing this editor's contributions, I didn't find anything that stuck out as terrible mistakes or evidence of possible mop abuse, however, I don't believe this editor has enough experience yet.  The last 100 or so edits were all reverts using [[WP:MWT]].  Not to lean too heavily on editcountitis, it will be extraordinarily difficult to pass an RFA with only 646 edits.  Personally, I'd like to see a lot more edits in the mainspace, because, after all, we are here to build an encyclopedia.'''No''' at the moment. This user has potential, but doesn't have any background regarding admin areas in the project space. --'''Support'''. I remember Chacor's last admin stint well, and he was indeed exceptional for the most part. He made an error, and I honestly believe that he has learned from it. The community would seriously benefit from Chacor being given the admin tools once again. Chacor's error of judgement in creating a sockpuppet account was pretty serious, but I cannot really say that the edits he made in the highlighted incident compare with other high profile errors made by admins. I think we must be prepared to forgive people - something we as a community haven't always been that good at doing.'''Support''' - Mistakes are in the past now, I have plenty of confidence you will do a peachy job.'''Support''' I'm willing to go out on a limb. After a while, the past is the past. The candidate has served his time, and has taken the time to regain the trust that he had lost. Full marks to the nominee for sticking with the project and contributing constructively despite everything else. That demonstrates a sense of character that cannot be ignored.'''Support'' I, too, feel he deserves a second chance. For example, Carnildo is a great asset and sysop, too, after he got a second chance, and I don't see why Chacor can't be given one also.'''Neutral''' and willing to step down/recalled from adminship if the community decides, the reason why chacor voted twice in my rfa was my fault and I apologize for this, Chacor contacted me in IRC right after he opposed my rfa via his NSLE nic, he was that I'm in rfa again, and I was thinking about the chacor account being strange as a new editor finding RFA so quick, I guessed NSLE was chacor so he said don't tell anyone and that he will use his NSLE account to support and cancel out the vote, I should have declined, but i wasn't really paying attention to the rfa anyways (had major arm surgery a few days back and was under the effect of painkillers and typing with one hand) so I ignored it, i wasn't following the rfa much thinking it was going to be another failure, it was nothing to do with blackmail and that kind of crap, it was Chacor decision. Sorry about this and I'll be willing to step-down from adminship and try again in several months if asked.'''Oppose''' - Editor doesn't demonstrate a need for the tools. Also, only one XfD contribution and three AIV contributions, I don't see any [[WP:PROD]] or [[WP:SPEEDY]] nominations in the editor's contributions, so I can't see that the editor understands deletion policies.'''Moral support''' as there is no participation yet at XfD or policy pages.

The oppose reasons thus far are either unconvincing to me or happened too long ago. - <font face="Trebuchet MS">Character assassination and ancient history aside, I am thoroughly convinced that Elonka being given the sysop tools will be a net gain for the project, especially with her being open to recall if she conducts herself poorly above and beyond the normal learning curve of those who have newly gained the tools.

'''Support'''. -- '''''Strong Support'''. While I may not be familiar to many here, I have been a registered member for 2 years, and a contributor for longer (previous ISP/IP). For nearly two years, my contributions were few, and far between, simply for the reason that I was busy in RL, but rest assured, I was reading, and learning. I have read many, many RfAs, and yes, I'm still learning; it has taken me several days to go through the viewpoints offered here. My apologies in advance for my verbosity. I met Elonka recently, simply because she'd found some of the messages I post to user's pages, and she dropped by to say they were cute, and appreciated. I responded, and we struck up a dialog, about our shared interests. She went on to assist me in an issue I had been drawn into while on Vandal patrol, with a very satisfactory outcome, showing both a willingness to see both sides of an issue, and the ability to remain neutral and offer a compromising alternative. I've read the concerns the opposition has voiced, and here is what my opinion is. First: She has freely offered to be open to recall. She is further supported by not one, but two nominating, established and respected administrators. That tells me she knows fully what the outcome of any questionable actions on her part would be. Second: At the heart of Wikipedia, I believe, is one of the values of Jimbo Wales: Quality not Quantity. There can be absolutely no doubt in anyone's mind, that Elonka's quality of contributions is in line with that value. It is one thing to make 30,000 minor edits. It is fully another thing to have the ability to take multiple articles (some in their infancy) and bring them to Featured Status. Third: We '''all''' are encouraged to assume good faith, to give second chances, and to forgive others of past mistakes. It seems to me, that many on the "oppose" side, are still holding grudges, some for actions that are many months, if not years old. I would encourage everyone to consider the great depth of knowledge that Elonka could bring to this wonderful community, and be encouraged knowing there are more than enough people here to "watch over" her (so to speak,), to be sure none of the past issues arise in the future. To err is human, and obviously, with 30,000+ edits, Elonka's passion is undeniable, of course some issues will become important to her. Mistakes are made by everyone at some point. Let us forget the issues of long ago, and welcome Elonka's vast knowledge with open arms, knowing that if any future issues come up, they will be dealt with appropriately. (And, to answer any doubts, nobody asked me to vote.) <sup>'''Support''' - looks like a capable candidate, per [[User:Phaedriel|Phaedriel]], [[User:Durova|Durova]] and [[User:Andrevan|Andre]]'''Support''' this capable candidate.  This is not a popularity contest, nor is it the forum for ancient personal grudges.  Have some decency and move on, people.  Move on.'''Oppose:''' Shameless self-promoter, who has figured out how to manipulate Wikipedia.'''Oppose''': While Elonka's a very prolific and intelligent ''editor'', some of the behaviors raised by the prior oppose !voters with more direct experience with this candidate gave me immediate "go neutral" pause about how she'd be as an ''admin''.  The more I've looked, waiting around for answers to my questions, the less I've liked what I'm seeing. (whatever the ArbCom decided, evidentiary links to one's edit history don't lie). Even aside from chronic (note I do not say constant) disruptiveness, wikilawyering, failure to understand how consensus works, compromise at the expense of [[WP:CENSOR]], editwarring, inappropriate attempts at speedy deletion, and such, there's just something deeper that's not quite right here, something overly self-interested.  I don't ever recall anyone else with an alleged vanity article up for AfD who defended it by engaging in indignant assertions of their own awesomeness ''in the third person'' like Bob Dole.  That may have been months ago (I made mistakes back then, too, and have changed), I don't see sufficient evidence of Elonka internally absorbing the Wikinature any better, ''just getting more skilled at playing the game''. A case in point would be the avoidance of uncomfortable questions on this RfA (and she has been plenty active today; I checked Special:Contributions), while letting her rather aggressive supporters rant against those daring to ask non-fluffy questions. If this were my RfA they'd've already been asked by me to refrain from any further comment, I would have apologized to those ranted at, and answered their questions; but Elonka seems to feel that her win-margin is secure enough or something that she doesn't have to do anything but sit back and wait.  With several more days to go that might not actually be the case.  Anyway, once the whiff of wikipoliticking in the air, that's it for me. — <b><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">'''Oppose''', too much to consider to sit on the fence any more. Yes, great contributor, but having looked into why others have moved from neutral to oppose, I share the uneasy feeling about trusting Elonka with the tools right now. Hopefully not never, just not yet. <b>'''Oppose''' a critical quality of an admin is to recognize when his or her personal views are not consensus. I cannot trust that the nominee would make the judicious calls of keeping articles or letting others decide (at afd rather than a speedy) in close situations, when her personal choice would be to delete them.'''Strong Oppose''' - I haven't edited wikipedia for several months, and this RfA only came to my attention when another wikipedian emailed me with “''Make sure to vote on Elonka's RfA as you've interacted with this user before''”. While i was editing Wikipedia, i had one major encounter with Elonka that lasted several months, and resulted in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Naming_Conventions|Naming Conventions ArbCom Case]]. The many weeks i spent dealing with her during the course of this dispute leads me to strongly oppose this nomination for the simple reason that i '''cannot trust her''' to use admin tools sensibly, and to not take unfair advantage of her position as an administrator during disputes should she be granted this position. I'll give one example of why i say i cannot trust her with admin tools – when a page is renamed (i.e. Moved), the old name automatically becomes a redirect page. However, anyone (i.e. Non-admins) can reverse the move as long as this automatically created redirect page is never edited again. In the page move wars during this dispute, Elonka made useless edits (e.g. Inserting a white space) to redirect pages that were created by article moves, just to make sure that no one else could reverse her page moves. This means the page moves she made would be 'stuck' unless and admin came in and deleted the redirect. This is a clear example of gaming the system to further herself in a page move war (which is a bad thing to start with) where she and all others involved where non-admins. Now, if she had been an administrator, what reason would I have to believe she would not also have used her admin powers to further herself? (For the record, the evidence for this incident is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Naming_Conventions/Evidence#Elonka_and_MatthewFenton_intentionally_blocked_return_moves|here]], however, most of the redirects in question where deleted at some point by admins. So the links on that page are to deleted version and will only work for admins). know this is old (the ArbCom case happened in December last year), but reading the reasons behind the 30 or so other oppose votes here, i've found no evidence that her behaviour has improved at all in the last seven months. Yes, she has made many valuble contributions to articles, but at the end, i think what shows the most about an editor is how they handle disputes, especially ones where they are on the 'wrong side'. Everyone can handle things well when they are being supported by other people, but when they are on the 'losing side' of a dispute, how they react says a lot. Elonka, in that one dispute i witnessed, showed she was ''willing to do everything and anything'' to prove that she was 'right', to the point of trying to game the wikipedia system, throwing around false accusations, and being downright misleading. Things like this are hard to prove, but i think [[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&diff=92602144&oldid=92601793|this]] nails it fairly well. Being an administrator is proof that you are a trusted and respected member of the community - especially for those new to wikipedia who may not yet understand what an “administrator” on wikipedia means. Being an administrator makes you a role-model, and (in some sense) a representative of the wikipedia community, it means a newbie who isn't familiar with wikipedia himself will take you more seriously and trust what you say about wikipedia. There are systems in place to ensure administrators don't abuse their tools, but as i just pointed out, tools aren't the only thing adminship gives to you. We need to trust our administrators to respect consensus and policies, even when they don't ''personally agree''. And this is where Elonka fails. --'''Oppose''' - I don't trust editors who think it's okay to write articles about themselves and their relatives and then put links to their website [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Linksearch&target=%2A.elonka.com&namespace=&limit=500&offset=0 across many Wikipedia pages].'''Oppose''' per Rebecca, Danny, SMcCandlish, and Sarah, to name a few.Per irisdescent.

Eukesh has my support.'''Support''' - When he is trusted in so many other Wikipedias, I do not find any reason that he should not be entrusted with adminship in English wikipedia where more stringent checks and balances exist for administrators which preclude the possibility of any serious abuse of his authority as an administrator. I also agree with [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] and [[User:Rama's Arrow|Rama]]. Moreover, English wikipedia certainly requires administrators exposed to [[South Asia|South Asian]] realities as I have sometimes encountered highly unusual information in certain pages related to South Asian topics though I do not exactly remember the pages. A sure support. --'''Support''' Experienced as sysop in other wikipedias, won't abuse tools here. As mentioned above, the primary rules and goals are similar in all wikipedias.--'''Support''':  Has been a highly active user and coordinator among many South Asian Language Wikipedias.  He has lead an effort to breakdown barriers in contributing to Wikipedia by various language users.  Adminship at English Wikipedia will help to continue his good work.  --'''Oppose''' Adminship is about trust ''and'' competence.  While work on other wikis demonstrates the former, the en.wiki is sufficiently different such that it does not necessarily demonstrate the latter. Editor's experience in project-space here is very low.  Malformed RfA is another negative indicator that candidate has basic knowledge still to learn.'''Support'''. Everyking does have his issues which have gotten him into trouble in the past. But he is nevertheless an excellent contributor who has been of great benefit to RC patrol and has worked well and hard with a broad spectrum of articles. Especially the fight against vandalism will gain a big boost with Everyking's presence.'''Support''' A superb admin who should be given a second chance for the good of the project.--'''Support'''. Obvious support here - never abused admin tools (indeed they were used well), removal for political reasons only. Contributing to wikipedia review is not a crime.'''Support'''. (Changed from Neutral) I think it was really inappropriate for this user to be de-sysopped. I think it's pretty clear upon review of the evidence that Everyking didn't know there was personal information when he offered to furnish deleted copies of the article. The fact that he was de-sysopped without even divulging the information is ridiculous; I'm not sure I'd agree with a de-sysopping even if he had. And contrary to the comments of at least one oppose !voter, there is nothing wrong with giving out copies of deleted articles, and in fact many admins do this on request. Everyking was wrongfully de-sysopped and I support his reappointment. –&nbsp;'''Support''', we should have the cability to forgive a [[mistake|misteak]]. Also another way to view this is to consider the number of errors per edit? When you consider he has some 90,000 edits surely his ratio from this point of view is rather good?'''Oppose''' - per extensive block log, bans, and ArbComs. Moreoever, the kind of attitude displayed in the comment on MER-C's RFA is, in my opinion, not the right mentality. This is not a battleground for a whopping great war between so-called "deletionists" and "inclusionists". And continued Wikipedia Review participation, with posts that contain some less-than-plesant material, is a no-no for me.'''Strong Oppose''' Per ArbCom/Block log, and affiliation with Wikipedia Review.

Lack of article writing, and lack of RC patrol, which is even more important than NP patrol (any new articles are logged on RC, in case you are wondering).

The suppression of a link to [[Daniel Brandt]]'s site in a Signpost article about him is just one of many examples of silliness perpetrated in the name of this idiotic policy.'''Support''' Intelligent, independent but not grandstanding, process-oriented and circumspect.

I can't quite figure out if he's fuzzy in his thinking about attack sites, is using overly wordy descriptions for a clear position, shifted his position, or if the amount of confusion by other users has confused me.  Regardless, it is a passive attitude (e.g. you don't have to be an admin ''not'' to remove an attack site) on a single issue outside his stated areas of interest in the realm of moppery.  I'm also not prone to moral panic about users making semi-automated edits.  I am especially unimpressed by arguments that "There is such a backlog that his judgment must be impaired during extended periods of digging through it" as this appears to be an argument that the backlog should not be tackled. If he does some automated stupidity with the mop, the ArbCom will desysop him, which is deterrent enough.  (Also and in a "totally not directed at any specific user or in a PA manner"-kind of way, the annoyance caused by users who want to co-nominate, apparently because they like to feel special but have nothing to add, hurts the candidate.) -'''Support''', hesitancy and caution in action are qualities we need ''more'' of in the admin pool.

The community has said no twice recently and is saying no again. I think that someone who has the balanced, mature and patient personalty required for coolly making awkward decisions would take this information on board and now take a very long break before even thinking of applying again. And perhaps wait to be nominated by someone. Applying again within the next three months might again cause people to oppose purely on those grounds. Display the patience and good judgement that is required of an admin and people might just be keener to give support.You're waiting about a month between RfAs, despite the fact that numerous people have mentioned that you need to give it more time. You really need to be more receptive to feedback, especially when you volunteer yourself for it (as happens in an RfA).

He also said this in his comments: "Wikipedia is a hobby for me, not an unpaid career. Even so, I take it seriously, and I believe that I am a good editor." I agree. Some people are instant minimum time experience sysops because they sit in front of a screen 17 hours of day, with a twelve-pack of beer and truckload of junkfood. A good editor isn't always like that. I support EM with practical reasons, because he has been here for so long and has a differnt perspective on the project. My moral support is that I feel, through reading the opposes and neutrals, that those reasons are partly because you're not an admin clone. It is very good for having someone with the same goal, but different perspective. I don't feel if he was given the mop, he'd blow up the site.'''Support''' &mdash; no reason not to.

I also must point out that SlimVirgin who started the opposes also did a thread elsewhere (related to the Runcorn socks) saying that some people will keep all their incivilities on just one account and then make a new account that only does vandal fighting and avoids conflicts so when it gets nominated for adminship it has a clean record and SlimVirgin says that sort of thing is bad and it's better to see how people handle disputes then having them hiding them. IvoShandor got in a dispute and then later apologized. I don't think that's too bad. Also, IvoShandor, I think, is a pretty light-hearted and funny guy.

However, I think that if a candidate uses some automation, I expect to see a very high caliber of other work: I'd like to see major foundation involvement, or significant involvement in policy evolution, or something similar to that as a means of evaluation for their critical thinking and judgement skills.  In this case, unfortunately, I don't see any way to really evaluate critical thinking.  However, I also don't have enough to push me to oppose.  So, regretfully, I remain neutral on this RfA.

But please be careful with the word "cruft" - it can be offensive to someone when you apply it to a topic that is important to them.  Just because something doesn't meet Wikipedia's notability guidelines doesn't mean that some people don't consider it important and we don't need to be insulting or perform a victory dance when we delete it. As with StuffOfInterest below, I'm concerned when you talk about someone accepting their fate.  This is not an us vs them - we are all here to try and improve the encyclopedia.

I'm glad to see that MER-C writes articles as well as just voting for their deletion.

His contributions to AFDs have been plentiful but rarely constructive. —'''Oppose''' From the evidence presented here, it is clear that the editor still benefits from having his deletion decisions checked by others.

Generally, his performance on AFD is reasonable and responsible, even though there is a lopsided number of "delete"s there.

I think it's best to be steady. There are many many users who have never changed names, never deleted their pages, never resigned their adminships and then asked for them back, stayed cool through controversy, in short, have been pretty solid about who they are and where they stood. Your comments about the recall process also show that perhaps you didn't really understand the ramifications of the committment, and the perception the community had that you were changing things as you went, while perhaps partly unfair, was caused at least in part by not having set things out clearly enough at the start. I'm working to encourage category members to change that, see [[Wikipedia:Administrators open to recall/Admin_criteria]]. I strongly suggest some time as an editor to rebuild your reputation, before asking again for reconfirmation. I almost opposed over these points but in the end didn't see the sense of piling on, I don't see this as successful... a neutral gives me the chance to make these points just the same.

I honestly don't mean to be all negative - she is a great article-writer, and has a sense of humour which I would love to see displayed more often, and perhaps even realise that it's OK to use that humour in situations where she is angered or irritated.

Have you ever started an article, or expanded one? I'm not looking for a featured one, or a good one, but looking at answer 2 you don't appear to have written ''anything''.

That affair doesn't allow me to cast a vote for support in good conscience.'''Oppose''' Reccomend immediate withdrawal after which you should wait until you have several months of experience under your belt.

For about 24 hours (or less), there was a discussion, intiated by yourself, at [[WP:VPR]] about deleting the Reference Desk (Miscellaneous section). It was pointed out a couple of times that the discussion should be at MfD, but despite this, there was a clear consensus presented that the desk be kept, even iwthout full process. A few hours ago, you opened the MfD ([[Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous|here]]), but in the process [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29&diff=prev&oldid=112633749 deleted] all of the previous discussion. This really confused me, and seemed inappropriate. We've seen very recently on Wikipedia that deleting debates causes problems, and that they should just run their course - I'd prefer to see an admin hopeful having this sort of understanding. Also, I wouldn't be comfortable with you taking care of XfDs, especially given your expression [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&diff=prev&oldid=112650208 here] that MfD is a vote. Perhaps the edit summary was a slip of the tongue, but your action of simply removing the emboldened part gives me the bad impression that you would, as an admin, decide XfDs on the basis on the bolded parts, rather than reading the discussion. Keep up the good work, and get to know process a bit more, commenting in XfDs and other discussions, and come back under a non elf-nom in a few months <tt>:)</tt> <strong>[[User_talk:Steel359/Archive_7#RE:Category:Request_for_protection|See this conversation]]. Parker created a category and template that were redundant with [[WP:RFPP]], so after discussion I deleted them. He wasn't very happy about that, and hounded me to delete [[:Category:Wikipedia protected edit requests]] as well. I naturally declined to speedy delete an established process. At that point, Parker took it upon himself to wipe the category off the map himself [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Editprotected&diff=prev&oldid=103929183] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Editprotected&diff=prev&oldid=105223756], using my exact words in a highly [[WP:POINT|POINT]]y fashion [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Wikipedia_protected_edit_requests&diff=prev&oldid=105225581]. A few days later he started accusing me of being biased against (non-notable) female porn stars because I'm not heterosexual, and posted a [[User_talk:Steel359/Archive_7#No-Confidence_Motion_regarding_Steel.27s_Adminship_uses|no-confidence motion]] on my talk page, threatening to "dig up much much more from [my] archives". All this because I refused to speedy delete [[:Category:Wikipedia protected edit requests]]. Parker as an admin? No thanks. &ndash;'''Oppose''' – Disclaimer: I am active on the Reference Desks, so Parker would apparently see my view as an attack, however I would wonder how people are supposed to reach a conclusion as to a candidate’s suitability if not through their actions. And this is based on Parker’s actions. The suggestion to delete [[WP:RD/M]] seemed based on pickiness rather than the benefit to Wikipedia’s users and editors. While there is a role for that sort of view, I don’t think that role is an admin who is active in AfD/MfD/etc. Other comments by Parker (such as the suggestion to delete all questions that are not signed) seem to show an intolerance, or misunderstanding of the needs, of people inexperienced with Wikipedia. In addition, and this is probably less helpful, I get a general bad feeling about this. Parker seems to strike an argumentative tone, when a calmer approach and reason would be much more effective.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&diff=next&oldid=112643979] While I can understand losing your cool, leaving the computer for a while and returning to edit/reply when calm would be a more positive action.

He works in a difficult area of history and is to be commended for his efforts.'''Strongly oppose'''. Per previous RfA (arguments given then) and his current POV-izing (very perfidious and "hidden"). He places filtered and channelized informations. A person has been rejected 4 times (5th time somebody deleted my vote "oppose" because of "unusual circumstances" and transferred it to the talk page). Is that enough!? Has any Pax's supporter here read the arguments on previous RfA's? "That was long ago" is not an argument.<br />The supporters only live in their world, without asking themselves what are those opposers saying. The supporters of Pax don't know the history of countries concerned in "problematic" articles, where Pax gave his contributons. He plays perfidious game, and those uninformed "buy it".<br />Some of Pax's supporters are here, because they support his cause. It would be nice to hear Kosova Albanian's vote here also. We still have no Shqip voter. The same thing is with the Bosnian Muslims. We still have no any vote from them. Some of them have also few things to say about Pax's POV.<br />Those who don't know him "get easily on the bait". Whenever Pax's intends to be an admin, he begans to "play nice". Do you know the axiom about wolf's hair and character?<br />Recently, he became too annoying to some users. If some users don't want to communicate with him, he should understand that, not to persist on communication. Annoying is a way of bad behaviour. User's talk pages aren't Pax's noticeboards. He annoyed me (I had to ignore him or delete his postings, I hope he finally got the message), and, as I see, user Mig11 (see the Mig's reactions  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMig11&diff=99809388&oldid=99761007] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mig11&diff=next&oldid=99823222]..<br />His report to the checkuser pointed towards me is special story. A try to kick out the serious opponent, which beats his filtered and channelized information. One of his the arguments of his accusation was that I have similar interest in a topic, that one vandal/trol had. But, point is, that he also has the interest in that topic - article Pagania. <br />About examples. Here are some recent ones. On the talk page of Pagania, he persistently pushes the story about Serbhood in that medieval duchy. His lines "''unified Serbian state''", "''unified Serbian realm''" are open greaterserbianism [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APagania&diff=119537850&oldid=119233643]. His text about "autochtonous Serb" is greaterserbian propagandist POV [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APagania&diff=119537850&oldid=119233643].<br />On the talk page of the article Ante Starčević he obviously doesn't understand the meaning of word racism. At least, his arguments are equal to zero, especially when dealing with such heavy qualification of a person.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MaGioZal&diff=prev&oldid=131166070]. On the talk page of user MaGioZal. "Croat, Serbs, Serbo-Croat-like peoples are probably all one people". You could imagine his "neutrality" on the matters of distinguished Croatian and Serbian language.<br />On the talk page of user Sideshow Bob, he expressed again his greaterserbianism. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sideshow_Bob&diff=next&oldid=101442315], claiming that Bokelji "were and are Serbs". Despite numerous Croat community there. <br />Then, look at his contributions on [[Talk:Croatian_War_of_Independence]] (section Relevance of Memorandum).(user Marinko talked with him, we don't have his vote here). "''...Not all of Croatia wanted to secede, a large portion of its population didn't want to....''" and "''key fact is that Serbs wanted to stay in Yugoslavia''". Original research. Croatia wanted to became independent, to dissolve the partnership. Not to secede. Then this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACroatian_War_of_Independence&diff=110211529&oldid=110074949] They (forces dispatched by Vuk Drašković's party) went to defend '''Serb civilians''' from ethnic cleansing and discrimination. Total greaterserbian POV. Bosnian Serbs do what they want in Bosnia, and Pax speaks about "defence of civilians", defending openly greaterserbian politician? Any Croat, Bos.Muslim, Albanian will confirm that).<br />About criticism of users that aren't editing on day-by-day basis: what does that mean? That they don't have a right to vote? Who says that they don't know the matter, because of that? They dealt with similar topics as Pax, so they know what are they talking about and whome they are talking about. So, according to supporters, no user can go on vacation for a few weeks (because Rfa voting period is 7 days), if he wants to vote on crucial wiki matters? Obviously, it did happen what I've warned in previous RfA's: these candidacy for Pax's RfA will be persistently "pushed" till finally the opposers' absence because of various reasons (hospitalized, private life obligations- children, some have a lot to work with no time to write wiki-contributions...but they can still follow RfA's), and of course, vacations. <br />Arguments that "opposers came from the same country". Of course. That country was a target of greaterserbian imperialism. Laotans and Bushmans don't care a lot about greaterserbianism, it doesn't have any impact on theirs' lives. <br />If some users like/love/adore Pax, they can confirm and proove their friendship and sympathies towards him in other ways, but not by giving adminship. Let's stay serious. If you think he's a nice person, that's your opinion. Stevie Wonder is probably a nice person in private life, but I wouldn't take him to drive my car (especially with me in it).<br />Why is someone insisting on adminship of an user that was rejected so many times? There were and there are good reasons why he's not an admin.'''Neutral''' me too. Given all the issues lately I feel uncomfortable with the history. sorry cheers,'''Neutral'''. The low use of edit summaries is irritating b/c when someone looks through a user's edit history the lack of summaries makes determining information more difficult, even if edit summaries are used for all article edits.

I believe the user could EASILY become a good admin, but what worries me is the lack of confidence my fellow Wikipedians have in them.  I believe that a good admin doesn't stem from editcounts, good work statistics, nor heavy involvement.  But all those things are very key.  But what they really need is trust, and the trust of admins and editors to not have issues, nor to have even the slight possibility of abusing the tools.  I would LOVE to support you and your efforts, but I am deeply sorry: I cannot.  It has become apparent that several people, including some who have quite esteemed editing careers here, do not wish to see you as an admin right now.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not give up; persevere.  This will allow you to not only improve yourself as an editor: it will greatly improve your standing here.  I'm not suggesting that you need this, but alas, this is only the advice of an editor at 4am.  I believe you to be a good editor, but not in the correct mindset at this time for the tools.

Some of the oppose votes seem a little excessive; what I'm troubled by is this editor's desire to stop editting when conflict arises.

Admins must be able to act with civility, even when under stress. As many admins will attest, administrators face criticism and abuse on a daily basis, and the spam seen in this diff doesn't even approach the rude comments that admins have to put up with. I suggest that in the future, please refrain from expressing yourself like that, and if you feel very stressed by something or someone, consider stepping back or at least pausing before making hasty comments. Even if this was a reference to ''Snakes on a Plane'', it was inappropriate and shouldn't have been said.

I'd suggest you follow the Rambling Man's good advice and withdraw the request, as it is unlikely to succeed. Most people at RFA will be looking for a solid knowledge of policy, probably demonstrated by edits to the Wikipedia name space. In any case, being an administrator is not very glamorous. Active administrators generally spend their time on very boring tasks. As for dealing with vandalism, you can revert most vandals yourself. It is made easier with [[WP:POPUPS]] or [[WP:TWINKLE]], which anyone can use. For page move vandalism, you can use the {{tl|db-move}} speedy deletion tag. If you do want to be an administrator, have a look at [[Wikipedia:What administrators do]] as it explains the grisly details. Experience at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion]] is generally considered useful. On the whole, adminship is no big deal, just a few more buttons. It also means that it isn't a big deal not to be an administrator. Thanks for volunteering and better luck next time,'''Oppose''' and suggest withdraw.  With 69 edits since last September (15 of which have been in your self-nom RFA), and a malformed RFA I would suggest this RFA goes not much further.'''Oppose''' -Lack of Experience for sure and very low "Wikipedia" contributions(for AngusMclellan), actually more then half your Wikipedia contribution is applying for Adminship but I believe if you apply in another 4 or 5 months, I will Definetly support you..--<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:small;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;">I'm not usually one to use arbitrary metrics as a measure of someone's ability, so I won't oppose based on that but the very low wikispace edits makes it hard to judge the user's grasp on policy.

Nothing here to make me oppose, just nothing here to make me support, either.'''Neutral - Gently suggest withdrawl''' I'd strongly urge you to review the comments left here, to review some various RfAs (both successful and not), and to watch the RfA page for several months, reviewing issues that are brought up, and seeing how the entire process works, before you nominate yourself again. Good luck! <sup>'''Oppose'''.  I agree with the above comments.  You are a good editor, but more experience is necessary, especially in the Wikipedia namespace.  I recommend partipating more in [[WP:XFD]], that's one of my favorites.

We have had teenage admins before, and I'm afraid I do not understand opposes based on ageism. I do recall reading conversations where the ability of the nom rather than the age of the nom was to be the determining factor. Please correct me if I've missed something, like an age limit being agreed upon.'''Support'''. A good user with solid contributions to the project. My only concern is age, not so much because of maturity (the candidate's apparent maturity trumps that concern easily), but because the project will be one of a growing list of demands on the candidate's time. So long as the candidate bears in mind the fact that the survival of the project does not rest on their shoulders, and that it's OK to take time for other things (as anyone of that age will know is necessary), I'm fine with this user as an admin. Best wishes,I have seen Preston's editing - he should do fine. The age concerns expressed below are bogus. -- <strong>'''Oppose''' Age is a concern imo when it comes to different things like e.g. the ability to see deleted pages. This in itself wouldn't be sufficient reason to oppose, but in conjunction with an [[User:PrestonH/Autograph_Book|autograph book]], I personally have serious doubts whether the necessary level of maturity has been reached. Disclaimer: Since this reasoning is based on my personal [[floccinaucinihilipilification]] of autograph pages, I cannot and don't expect anyone to follow my logic. [[WP:NOT#SOCIALNET|But still]]. I&nbsp;I suspect some real life issues are presently affecting this editor and that is the reason he os on a wikibreak during his RfA. Certainly his choice but it makes me think he is unsuited for the job at the moment. As far as the age of an admin is concerned I know we have some that are very young. But they are the exception. Therefore, when a very young person requests the janitor keys we must be doubly sure they are also one of the exceptions. I just don't see it here. Now, next year? Perhaps. But let's see. -'''Oppose''', not sure I would trust the user with the tools at this time.  This is not because of his age, but I would suggest opposing based on age/maturity is entirely reasonable and the dramatically-bolded expressions of anguished astonishment are unhelpful.'''Support'''. Dragons flight is already an admin and does a good job running bots and the reasons stated for why this account here needs admin rights are valid. Dragons flight can fully be trusted to use this account carefully and as explained (and for nothing else). This is not a cookie cutter RfA. So, discussion contributors should carefully check the motivation behind this RfA and think about how the underlying problem (protecting templates affecting the main page) should be solved without this bot if this RfA should not pass. Many thanks to Dragons flight for doing all this work. --'''support''': great user, answers to questions are awesome. (Actually, this bot could really help!)--This whole idea of an RFA is utterly unnecessary.  The bot's op is already entrusted with the sysop bit, so I don't see the necessity of making him go through this extraneous process to get a ''second'' one.  He's already trusted, and bot ops are responsible for the actions of their bots, so, granting this bit should just rely on Bot Approvals Group or bureaucrat discretion.  If it malfunctions it can always just be blocked.  RFA is entirely geared towards determining the acceptability of human candidates to be admins; try applying the process to a robot candidate whose human owner is already an admin makes no sense.  --'''Strong Support'''. I'm happy to support and have no concerns with the idea of a bot with sysop status, and I would also suggest Shadowbot2 is given a full bot flag (if not given one already) and is entrusted with a backup role in case there is any problem with ProtectionBot, you know, just in case. --<font color="#27408B" size="2">'''Kind Regards - ''''''Support'''.

Let there be oversight, let the problems be worked out, let problems with the bots function reflect on its owner, let any abuse face severe and immediate consequences, and let the damned bot do its job and save us all a bunch of tedious, incredibly bot-like work. It'll do the job faster, without human error, and without complaint. I have nothing but respect for the people who take care of protecting these things, day-in and day-out, but I honestly don't see how you can enjoy what seems to me to be such mind-numbing work. Let the human admins put in their efforts where the human mind is needed. Where we have simple but very repetetive tasks, use bots. Isn't use of tools to solve problems supposed to be our strong point, as a species? As I said, oversight is important and should be present, these are reasons for ''caution'' more than outright opposition, in my book.'''Nervous support''' Like [[User:Just H|Just H]], the idea of a robot with admin privileges gives me the heebie-jeebies. (See Oppose #9, below)  I, too, saw ''[[Terminator 3]]'' and ''[[I, Robot]]''.  Unlike the robots in those stories, however, this bot is not (to my knowledge) resistant to human control - worse comes to worse, [[User:Dragons flight|Dragons flight]] can just turn it off.  As for the open-code objection, while I understand it, I think that any mature society must recognise the need to keep some things secret.  If the user is trusted, so should we trust his robot offspring.  Finally, while I find [[User:TShilo12|Tomer]]'s objection fascinating (the bot's lack of volition and, thus, the inability to accept a nomination for adminship, see oppose #3, below) I think that the objection shows the reason why the bot ''should'' be trusted; if it has no will, it cannot go rogue, cannot rebel against its human master, and cannot do anything but that for which it is designed: protecting the Main Page from being infiltrated by giant penises.  furthermore, [[WP:IAR]] allows us to ignore this technical objection, does it not?  For all these reasons, I give my support and best wishes to our new robot overlord.'''Support'''. None of the objections raised seem especially convincing and the benefits are clear.'''Conditional support''', provided you release the source under BSD, GPL, Public domain, or other free content license, and run another RFA if you do so much as add a comment. --'''Strong oppose''', at least until the bot accepts or declines the nomination.

Vandals who have the technical knowledge to modify the bot for vandalism purposes already have the technical knowledge to write a vandalbot from scratch.

I give you very high marks for beginning [[WP:YANKEES]] as that will entail considerable collaborative work which I happen to think is helpful for administrators. However, the project is only a week old so your collaboration there is minimal. It will be a great project and I am sure will attract a lot of attention. Your answer to optional #5 above by Nick concerns me some. The question was rather complex and probably needed a fuller answer. I'm just not sure you fully comprehend the depth of the issues there. As an administrator you would be called on to deal with image issues. I also think that your view of adminship is a bit too narrow. Please keep up your work here and continue your Yankees project. A little more exposure to some other areas will make you a home run for your next RfA.'''Oppose''' Not happy with answers to Q.4 or Q.5.

His field of expertise lies on technical issues, rather than article writing (as desirable as that would be); so I'm happy to support knowing that he'll make good use of the tools, adding his knowledge to them for the best of us all.'''Support''' I strongly opposed this nomination last time around but I think he has learned from his previous mistakes.  The main criticism about him now is evidently that he doesn't write enough articles.  I am an article writer and creator with nearly 16,000 edits and I don't have time for admin-type tasks although I do occasionally get pulled in.  The converse is that someone who spends his time doing admin doesn't have time for writing articles.  Fact is: you can only do one or t'other.  This lad seems to have a talent for admin and maybe the writing will develop as he gets older.  I was perhaps wrong to oppose him before because of his lack of experience around how to deal with an unfamiliar subject but I think he has taken that on board now and will be a good, reliable administrator.  Good luck to him, but I wish he would get a more imaginative username.  A good username should have at least three syllables: like mine has  ;-)  --<b>'''Support'''. I have seen the opposition based on the (lack of) encyclopedia building, but although the contributions there are on the thin side, the candidate has not come up ''empty'' there, he has some non-trivial contributions in various TV articles. Therefore, I believe he has some foothold in what the encyclopedia is about. I think R is a sensible person, and trust that he'll use the admin tools wisely.'''Oppose'''  I am sorry, I am unhappy with the answers to the questions.  The answer to question 1 gives me a strong feeling of 'I'll block them all', in combination to the answer to the [[WP:BLP]] question, where new users get template-warned, while experienced users get a personal message.  If someone needs to learn, then it are the new users, and I think they need the personalised message more than the others.<br/>I am combining that with [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:198.213.170.14&diff=prev&oldid=127566182 this] warning of two months ago.

I'm really concerned about your ability to assume good faith of other editors.

In them, you accused the closing administrators of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Wikipedia:Esperanza&diff=100811785&oldid=100808754 just not liking] MailerDiablo's closure.

Assuming good faith (both of new and old users) is a fairly important skill for an administrator, and I'm concerned that you do not have it.'''Support''' Contributions indicate that the candidate seems to have well-rounded experience of the most significant areas of Wikipedia, sound policy knowledge (as far as I could tell), has contributed a respectable amount to article space and there are no civilty concerns.'''Support''' - Good answers. P.S., The fact that there are zero opposes makes me think that you haven't really involved yourself in a lot of disputes. This isn't necessarily a good thing. Most of the best editors who have several thousand edits and have been involved in several disputes tend to make enemies who oppose their Admin nominations regardless. A lot of people take things personally and oppose editors simply because they don't like them if they've ever had disagreements with the editor. So the fact that there are zero oppositions tells me that you likely need to involve yourself in disputes more often and get out of your zone of comfort.'''Support, but with concerns''' - A very likable and polite editor, but the answers to questions seem confused, as Daniel noted.  Depending on whether or not you pass, I recommend you match up with an experienced admin so you can gain practical experience, or go through [[Wikipedia:Admin coaching]].

After you've contributed here for a bit longer, you can request an [[WP:ER|editor review]] to find out what other people think you can improve on, and from there you can consider going up for adminship again. I also suggest you withdraw this RfA, since there is no chance of it succeeding at this current time. ''''''Weak Support'''.

In addition to the above concerns with tone I would be inclined to oppose a user for admin powers with SP's level of experience. Still, my personal dealings with SP have been very favorable and he is an excellent editor. I'm always happy to see him active on an article and he has shown himself to be a very "project first" type, even in a situation where others might be inclined to let their conflicts of interest or personal feelings color their judgment.

However, I feel that conflict is a good thing - conflict is usually required to reach consensus. Overall, I feel that his contributions are tremendous, but the lack of any ''serious'' AfD contribution and the lack of working with AIV for someone who wants to help with vandalism just doesn't do it for me.'''Oppose''', because of the answer to question 4.  The previous RfAs spell out extensive concerns about civility, knowledge of policy, and a lack of substance to edits.

Copying and pasting from policies, especially when the result contains nonsense such "removing an article from talk pages," does not demonstrate an ability to exercise judgement.

Sry, but the power that comes with admin tools is a big deal, imho. This requires trust, that has to be earned, this isn't something to take on the light side. The points made by other users here, as well as the candidate's own statments, supports the view that Siva isn't taking the matter serious enough. If there would be other rules here, say, a "sunset clause" thazt required another vote after a probation time of six months, I would perhaps support this nomination. But not under these circumstances.'''Neutral''' to avoid pile-on, largely per HibernianTears (oppose 13).

I personally think you'll make a good administrator, but all you do is revert vandalism, although still a valuable and good job in it's self, it would be nice to see a varitation of article work/creation/vandal reverts. I also must point out that it appears you are unwilling to take advice, I commented on IRC that it maybe a good idea to tone your userpage down, as it is very bright and in your face.

First, these edits disturb me: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Polarwolf&diff=prev&oldid=160196683] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Domthedude001&diff=prev&oldid=160196594] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kornfan71&diff=prev&oldid=160196441] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Phaedriel&diff=prev&oldid=160641271] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ambirch1&diff=prev&oldid=160196345] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Efansay&diff=prev&oldid=160196159] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deflagro&diff=prev&oldid=160196045] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jackrm&diff=prev&oldid=160195862] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Djmckee1&diff=prev&oldid=160195428], as this could be considered [[WP:CANVASS#Excessive_cross-posting|excessive cross-posting]]. Additionally, the fact that the editor says "vote for me" further shows that the user does not understand that RfAs are not a "vote", but a [[WP:Consensus|discussion to determine consensus]]. I'm also concerned that the editor does not seem to understand [[WP:OWN]], as these edits would suggest, calling a project "my new commitee": [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Donato011206&diff=prev&oldid=159537301] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bahama58&diff=prev&oldid=159537250] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Qiufeng02&diff=prev&oldid=159537211] (and 19 others with exactly the same message). While I don't normally nit-pick spelling, when the name of a project is spelled incorrectly, (not intentionally) it does concern me, as spelling is something that comes into play with moving pages and creating redirects. As mentioned below, the lack of edit summaries are also a concern, and to Socks 01, I'd encourage you to go into your preferences, under the edit tab, and force edit summaries when you forget to make one. I'm not sure why the editor [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WWE_Smackdown&diff=prev&oldid=160184897 blanked the page] here, removing a redirect without explanation. If the editor has been watching [[WP:RFD]], I would think that at the least, an edit summary with an explanation would be given, but I still find no valid reason for blanking a redirect page like that. The editor says they have "created many articles", so I went to see what they looked like, and I could find only four, three of which are stubs, and one is an episode for a television show. Looking through the editor's talk page history, I see a repeated pattern of image problems, multiple notices, and multiple instances of the editor blanking their talk page, with no archiving. Wikipedia has an extensive infrastructure of policy, guidelines, and projects, and I do not feel this editor is even aware of many of the most important areas required by an administrator. All of this can change in time, of course, and I'd encourage the editor to watch RfAs for the next several months to get an idea of what is expected, and to find areas that the editor can participate in to get the necessary experience, such as [[WP:AIV]], [[WP:UAA]], [[WP:RFCN]], [[WP:AFD]], etc. I wish the editor much luck in the future, but at this time, I cannot support this request for adminship. <sup>'''Support''' per Ganfon. --[[user:teh tennisman|<font color="steelblue" face="Comic Sans MS">tennis</font>]][[user talk:teh tennisman|<font color="darkgreen" face="Comic Sans MS">man</font>]]'''Neutral''' You have nearly 20,000 edits, and a good spread into [[WP:NAMESPACE]].

Wikipedia wouldn't be wikipedia without people who write articles, however Wikipedia wouldn't be much of anything either if there weren't people like this who dedicated so much time to vandal fighting. Giving someone who spends this much time vandal fighting the tools to block vandals quickly would only benefit. This person seems to know the procedure in issuing warnings and I don't see them abusing the tools.'''Neutral'''. Still too new, would definitely consider in future, though. --'''Neutral'''.

The opposers don't persuade me otherwise. This candidate could do with some admin buttons. ''''''Oppose with sentiments of Support''' - I see an editor who has a specific need in which the tools can be applied, but without enough experience just yet. I think this is one of the better discussions I have seen here. Personally, I am less influenced by pure edit count, or places you have been editing, and more by the sample time available by which to judge your overall personality (to the flawed extent this can be done in a digital environment). Thus, following TwoOars logic, if you come back in a few months and simply have twice as many edits of the type you have been doing all along, that would be fine for me to support, because it would give me a longer period of time over which I can identify any patterns in your behavior which might lead me to support, or if I find anything that raises a red flag, oppose. One point of disagreement I have with TwoOars' reasoning: I am not a fan of the idea of rushing someone through an RfA simply because they might not be around Wikipedia in a few months. If that is the case, what's the point of giving you extra responsibility? Time served also demonstrates to me a commitment to the project. Come back in a few months, and if I see a continuation of what you have been doing thus far, an see that you have maintained the ability to learn and grow from mistakes, you'll have my support.I like your eagerness to fight vandalism, but you don't appear to have made any posts to [[WP:AIV]], which suggests a lack of experience in the area.

However, I'm not convinced you really know why you want admin status, and possibly just want it for the sake of it, and your number of talk & wikipedia talk/WPtalk posts is woefully low for an admin, so I've while I've no reason to think you ''don't'' understand policy, there's nothing to demonstrate that you do.

Also, as you said, since I'm not that knowledgeable about cricket, I AFD'd it, and asked you about all the other cricket pages you created, instead of speedying them all. Thanks for commenting'''''. Perhaps it's just me and I fully expect 300 different interpretations of the quote by close of play, but this statement, to me, shows TeckWiz will not do any research on an AfD nomination, rather he will just nominate articles when he doesn't know about the subject and presumably feels they might need to be deleted - this attitude, coupled with a total lack of research being carried out prior to nominating an article for deletion, makes me think I cannot trust TeckWiz to use the deletion tools properly and more importantly, responsibly.

However, there seems to be an issue with acting hastily and blowing the cool.  Also, I worry about answer to Q6 above:  ''there's really no need to keep an AfD discussion open if the nominator has withdrawn the nomination.''  I simply do not agree with this, as once the discussion has started, it should continue until consensus or other closure is reached.  This was an issue on another AfD ongoing.  I do see adminship in TPH's future, but maybe still a bit down the road, once more of the community is behind it. <em>&mdash;<font color="Indigo">'''Neutral''' Although I'd like to recommend him, I'm not yet convinced that he seriously wants adminship.'''Support''' (from neutral) While the issues brought up by users such as Paxse made me apprehensive about my decision, I have come to the conclusion that you deserve the admin tools you desire for one very important reason (which seems not to have been mentioned so far). The ability to admit when you're wrong is something precious, something that many many admins lack entirely. If you're so arrogant, how is possible that you have been so gracious and accepting of the constructive criticisms proposed by users such as Paxse? I find the accusation that you are self-centered or power hungry to be outright slander. I myself am one touchy, self-assured bastard, and I get along great with you in AFD. Unlike so many admins, you have patently demonstrated that you have the ability to learn from your mistakes and take constructive criticism to heart. This proves to me that while your previous actions may have been hasty in many instances, you will continue to improve by leaps and bounds, and thus deserve administrative  powers.'''Oppose''' He's a hard working and well meaning contributor but TPH is way too quick on the draw with nominations for deletion in my view and with admin powers might cause a lot of contributing editors a lot of grief.  For someone without admin powers he also seems to close a lot of AfDs early which also gives me pause for thought.  I wish he'd just slow down a bit.  This [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Amarillo_Bible_Church]] AfD was closed by TPH two minutes after it opened after no discussion at all.'''Oppose''' per DGG, especially.  I also have seen a general pattern of over-hasty action from the candidate.  I worry that he would not apply deliberative judgment in applying the CSDs in particular.   He certainly needs to slow down a bit, and think more thoroughly before acting.'''Oppose''' The Nazi box is very poor taste and so is the "Wikingpädi" nonsense. Being a citizen of a [[Nordic country]] I've way too often heard the American smear accusing Nordic people (=descendents of the Vikings) to be Nazis. You might be interested to know that the Nazis had very little following in our countries, which was clearly demonstrated during the [[Nazi occupation of Norway]] and [[Occupation of Denmark|Denmark]]. I have nothing against you personally, I don't know you, but "jokes" like these are not befitting for an admin.'''Oppose''' The box was a joke, and it is not a big deal. I'm concerned that the candidate chose to argue once it was clear that people were bothered by the box, and that they employed such an obvious red herring in the process.  Even though they finally removed it, their defense leaves me with doubts about their judgement and respect for other users. I also share DS's concern.

Well, The Transhumanist has been one of the best admin coaches I've seen, he certainly knows what it takes to be an administrator, and his virtual classroom has developed some excellent lessons which he has helped guide prospective admins into writing. It also shows his understanding of policy - which is second to none.

I'm convinced he'll do a fine job with the mop. :)'''Oppose''', a valued contributor, but the Q3 answer is just too troubling to grant the tools. '''· <font color="#70A070">'''Oppose''' per my past comments, the admin coaching thing, opposing commenters above, and especially your response to Krimpet just right above. I still think that you have the wrong impression of RfA and adminship in general. How is RfA bureaucratic? Tell me, how is writing articles, getting involved in Wikipedia processes, discussing with other editors, learning from some contentious major dispute, and filing a request (or have someone nominate you) bureaucratic? You are blowing a simple process completely out of proportion, turning a meager request into some quintessential trophy. Yes, no one wants oppose votes (who wants to be criticized?), but it is from opposition and criticism that we learn our faults, not from unanimous support. Yes, occasionally we get some absurd oppose rationale, but you seem to be working on the [[availability heuristic]] a bit too much. —''''''Oppose'''. A user who thinks competence can be taught probably does not have it. Also, he has a disruptive signature and his agenda scares me. Also, I do not feel that the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:The_Transhumanist&oldid=71244522 various] names this user has previously used were adequately noted in this request. —'''Support''', working hard positively to finally benefit Wikipedia as admin despite past RfA voting.'''Support''' 30k edits between accounts...

However I was taken by the fact that you cited [[WP:BITE]] in your answer to Q10. Good response. On balance I think you will be a net gain with admin tools.

Using them occasionally and properly is far more preferable than someone who uses them all the time and frequently uses them incorrectly.'''Oppose''' per Radiant.  Prior concerns have not been fully addressed.  Given the depth of candidate's misunderstandings in the past, I need to see solid evidence that he has become more deliberative and less excitable.  Even his acceptance of this nomination has me a bit worried, as if the candidate considers gaining the mop a very weighty matter.'''Oppose''' - I think the user is too bureaucratic in his view of Adminship.'''Oppose''' Sorry too little experience.However support your desire to do more in wikipedia.Please try again after a few months with more contributions.you will have my support.

The candidate's confusion and somewhat nebulous answers regarding consensus are making my confidence waver, and the new statement that he would afford "very little weight to new users, or users with very little experience" is disheartening.  New/inexperienced users should be viewed with a grain of salt, but "very little weight" just because someone is apparently new to the project?  This disenfranchises people just because they are not "active" editors, when they may have extremely valid points to make in a discussion.'''Weak support''' - could have more experience, however should be ok.'''Support''' - citing a lack of experience but failing to provide any evidence of this lack of experience having caused any problems is not a reasonable justification for opposing the candidate.  No reason to oppos, probably not mental, good enough for me.'''Oppose''' You only started editing here consistently since July. You also need more experience outside of vandalfighting.'''Neutral''' - Continuing with a week of thoroughly underwhelming RfAs, this seems to follow the trend.

He writes articles, fights vandals, and contributes in admin areas of the site. Has he made mistakes? Sure, we all have. Has he learned from them and grown? Yes, he has; something which can't be said for many here. The most important criterion for me is whether an admin will abuse the tools s/he is given. I have the utmost confidence that Tiptoety will only use them for the betterment of the project. I am proud to support him in his adminship candidacy.'''Oppose''' I wouldn't want someone who tried to speedily delete highly decorated Dambusters pilot [[Les Munro]] (and then took it to AfD) to have admin powers.  Editors who do nothing but delete vandalism don't understand the real business of the encyclopedia which is writing and improving articles.  Nominating that one minute after its creation wasn't 'helping new users'. If this was an isolated incident then I wouldn't mind but trying to delete an ancient king of Assyria the other day because he didn't have many google hits is just bizarre.  Other users have also noticed a lack of care in this RfA and above all administrators have to be careful.'''Oppose''' I was torn between neutral and oppose, as it really does seem that Tiptoety is a valuable editor who is honestly trying to improve the project. However, I have to oppose, though reluctantly. Not for any single reason; I might be able to overlook a single indiscretion (we've all made mistakes). However, the e-mail address incident, the copyvio incident, along with a mediocre mainspace editing history and two self-nominations at RfA combined are just too much to overlook. To be fair, you have a very good vandal fighting history; some people prefer strong mainspace work, others strong vandal fighting. I think they're both very important, and a lack of one is no reason (in itself) to oppose an RfA (though to be honest I personally prefer strong article building). I'm also confused as to how you can have a userbox saying you don't have the courage to nominate yourself, but this is your second self-nom (not that this plays any role in my oppose, mind you). My advice would be to scale back your vandal fighting a bit (we know you're good at that) and do some encyclopedia building. Build up a few quality articles, just to show that you have the ability. And ''please'' wait for someone else to nominate you next time! Some people (myself included) hate self-noms on principle; it just doesn't look good, to be honest with you. You do seem to have admin potential, I'd just like to see more balanced contributions from you, plus a little time to distance yourself from mistakes you've made in the past.

I have read the oppositions and don't believe they are that severe. It may be true that this user doesn't have a high amount of administrator knowledge but that doesn't mean he would somehow abuse the tools of adminship. It's not like we have a limited amount of adminships to dispense and must choose only the super elite. This person, based on my viewing of his previous contributions, looks like he would make good contributions as an admin and does not look like he would abuse the tools or cause problems.'''Support'''. This editor can be trusted with administrative tools and his adminship will benefit this encyclopedia. --'''Support''' At the end of the day the extra buttons come down to just one thing. Trust. We can argue all day along about editcounts, writing articles, project space, name space, civility, block logs, ammount of time between RFA's, use of the tools, edit summary use etc. etc. etc. '''At a fundamental level the question for me is, do I trust this user not to abuse the tools'''. And the answer is '''yes'''. I think you shouldn't have accepted nomination so quickly, because inevitably it would attract opposes as below. When you withdrew your last RFA I commented at your talk page that it was an admin quality action. I still believe it was. I therefore offer my support. Best.<small><span style="border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;">'''Neutral''' I also supported the earlier RfA, and although I understand the desire to see 'what would have happened', it would have been better to wait it out, improve based on previous RfA comments, and come back stronger. I echo the concerns of Espresso Addict above, but also want to note that I understand why you withdrew your previous RfA in the first place. You're a valuable contributor here and I hope you keep on with the dedication you've displayed.'''Weak Support''' - I didn't get what El_C's joke was about either, but reporting it to ANI was an extreme overreaction. I also don't think the answer to Q5 was entirely satisfactory; not all project leaders are necessarily admins, and the two jobs are rather different. However, in light of the candidate's frequent XfD participation and high editcount, this isn't a good enough reason to oppose. <font face="Verdana">'''Strong support''' - Tony is one of the hardest workers I've ever met on Wikipedia. He more or less singlehandedly revived the CHICOTW project (which is currently thriving and churning out GAs on a regular basis), he always has a friendly word and has been MORE than communicative in handling that project, he's made a great deal of mainspace edits in general, and is really an overall responsible and decent guy. I can't think of anyone who deserves this more. As for this El C "joke," I think it's in pretty poor taste. The timing and placement of this "joke" was unfair and reflects poor judgement, and it's in poor taste to then oppose someone's adminship based on the fact that someone momentarily tricked them, ignoring recognizing the huge amount of hard work they've put into the project. I have yet to meet an admin who is perfect.'''Oppose''' as per evidence brought up by Majorly and communication issues described elsewhere.'''Neutral''' leaning toward support.  Excellent contributions to Wikipedia as a whole and his dedication to the [[WP:CHICOTW]] prove he is a dedicated editor, but some of his answers and userpage make him look too eager for admin status.  Combined with some of the concerns expressed above keeps me from outright support however.'''Support''' - Seems to be an excellent editor. Has a lot of contributions to GA, FA, and DYK. I see this editor often on Afds, and I can trust him that he won't abuse the mop. --'''Support''' I supported in the previous RfA and I think there is even more cause for support now that the main concerns of the opposers are four months ago.'''Support''' Pretty hefty list of GA's, FA's, and the like there, and he sounds like a pretty good candidate to me.'''Strong support''' I've disagreed quite strongly with Tony about Chicago's use of a [[WP:ASR]] template in the article space.  But he's dealt with me politely and in good faith.  What's more important is the stunningly high quality of Tony's work.  Military History and the Featured Article projects both have directors—while in general, I agree, I'm not a fan of the titles—it's very obvious that they shouldn't be universally banned, and Tony's opinion on the matter doesn't represent any sort of failure to understand Wikipedia. --'''Oppose''' ack all concerns raised above, seems to be looking for some sort of award --''''''Oppose''' Respectfully, I must oppose based on the WikiProject Chicago issues raised above.'''Oppose''' (switch from neutral) Sorry Tony, I didn't want to do this, but the myriad issues raised here truly do suggest that you aren't sure how the Wikipedia community works and that you are not ready for the sysop tools.

I found Daniel's diff above to be refreshingly comical, since more people should believe in the "discussion" side of this process. At the same time, I am uncertain I can support you at this time since it is pretty easy to figure out what that tally box is, even if its significance is marginal. To that end, I want to be clear that I am not opposing because of a simple edit mistake. I see this less a reflection of your abilities (which are solid), and more a reflection on your amount of time here.

Though he strongly opposed my RfA, and was highly critical of me in several respects, he also stood up against unfair treatment toward me. That tells me he is a man of good character, and to me, character is king in an administrator. I cannot imagine him abusing the tools. -'''Support''' We don't always agree when we have been in discussions, but I DO agree that he would make an excellent administrator.  No reservations at all. --'''Support''' likewise. Great answers to the questions: now I can just put "see VanTucky's answer" if I get asked the same ;-) '''''Support'''; some of the oppositions below might have made me hesitate to support, ''if they were relevant to recent behavior''.  I've looked through the recent activity from VT and I see nothing that makes me think he will abuse the tools.  He sometimes is a little more curt than you'd expect from an admin, but I think he got the point by now and will be more careful.  &mdash;&nbsp;'''Weak support''' I believe VanTucky has a good track record in creating & improving content. There's plenty of relevant experience in administrative areas and collaborative efforts as well. I doubt this editor would ever abuse the tools. That said, VanTucky can be awfully abrasive, as demonstrated in several separate incidents linked below. I find myself in this section of the RfA, rather than neutral or even a weak oppose, because VanTucky has shown a capacity to admit mistakes and a willingness to accept constructive criticism. So here's mine: I support now because I expect stepped-up vigilance from VanTucky in the arenas of civility and good-faith assumptions, whether this RfA passes or not; this project cannot survive on content submissions alone, but requires an environment conducive to collaboration, and a few sour interactions can spoil that. Good luck. &mdash;'''Oppose'''. I think Van Tucky's aggressiveness in defending his GA review of [[SS Christopher Columbus]] — not a page I've had anything to do with — was completely inappropriate. I would rather not see admins throwing their weight about in this manner.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SS_Christopher_Columbus&oldid=170260980#Failed_.22good_article.22_nomination]'''Oppose''', After the reviewing the issues above, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/VanTucky&diff=170617648&oldid=170616514 response to Annalisa Ventola] and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/VanTucky&diff=170953809&oldid=170949363 Godwin diffs provided by Rlevse], I'm sorry, but I must change to oppose at this time.'''Oppose'''.

I would suggest that whatever the outcome of this RFA you take Daniel's comments to heart and learn from them.

Reluctant because Wantok seems like a very nice person, and I think that it's important or editors to be nice; but firm oppose because Wantok had, IMO, far too little experience of wikipedia. Before I could support, I'd need to see a lot more evidence of Wantok's approach to policy and to areas of conflict; but I hope that Wantok's great start to editing will be followed by a lot more. If this RfA fails, please don't that as a criticism, just as friendly "not yet". --'''Neutral''' I can't in all honesty support - I know editcountitis is A Bad Thing but I estimate that, of your 550 mainspace edits, at least 80-90% are reversions or extremely minor edits to footbal articles to update them with the new season's FIFA rankings. I see absolutely nothing in there that would lead me to oppose but nothing to lead me to support.

Almost everything you intend to do can be done just as well without admin tools.

''''''Oppose''' For starters, let me just say that I am not one to oppose. But quite simply I feel I must make a point here. My predominant concern is that of a lack of general experience, not only in mainspace, but also among the clockwork and policies of Wikipedia. I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?limit=500&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=Wenli&namespace=1&year=&month=-1 fail to see] much, indeed any discussion as do I see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?limit=500&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=Wenli&namespace=0&year=&month=-1 little concrete editing]. Most mainspace edits are AWB sweeps, inasmuch as the contributions are concerned. A fairly low edit count coupled with a lack of general experience is a no-no IMHO. Don’t take it bluntly but I do, quite frankly, feel that you would profit from a little more understanding. Furthermore, I note you have had little experience at AIV and no edits at ANI (as Rudget already mentioned). Consider some article writing too. One of the cornerstones of adminship is an all-embracing, all-inclusive and wide-ranging acquaintance with the “clockwork” of Wikipedia, something which I can’t seem to find in your contributions at the moment. --'''Development Cabal Support''': friendly, enthusiastic…if he can put up with my PHP, he can cope with the mop.

In the past it used to be much easier to be an admin because "it isn't a big deal" and we'd give it to those who could use it to benefit Wikipedia, as you clearly can.  It's terribly frustrating to have to ask someone to take care of a vandal you should be able to do yourself.  Not only are you inconvienanced, but so is at least one admin.  And this focus on edit counts really kills me.  Have you done anything *wrong*?  You clearly showed remorse for the one incident that has been brought to light.  Some of the objections to you (except for # of edit counts) could be said about me.  There are areas where even I'd not be considered for admin such as "Not enough recent experience" or even "I don't spend most of my time fighting vandals, but writing articles". For those with [[Wikipedia:editcountitis|editcountitis]], the [[Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits|edit count list]] back in March put current '''administrator and bureaucrat''' [[User:Redux|Redux]] at  2,431 (main namespace) edits.  That number is now 2,628.  Now I'm comparing apples and oranges, but looking at edit counts alone is about as ludicrious as saying Redux shouldn't even be an administrator because he doesn't write enough articles, has "only" 6,197 total, and is not even a top 500 user. --'''Support''' - Good contributions.

She states that "The two tasks which I have in mind are reverting vandalism, and asisting in the AfD/RfD/CFD process" but I see almost no vandalism reversions or warnings to users and I see zero edits to [[WP:AIV]]. Furthermore, although there are a fair number of edits to CfD, there are almost no edits to AfD and RfD.'''Oppose'''. 7900 edits is good, but not so good when only 100 or so are in the Wikipedia namespace.'''Weak Oppose''' - a little more experience wouldn't go amiss. --'''Support''' I have seen his name a few times on [[WP:AIV]], and every time it was a legitimate request for blocking.

The last admin request was unfortunate, to say the least, and I think a longer period of cooling of is required. Sure, the user has been active, but has CSCWEM really been involved in a true community nature? I honestly don't think so - it's more of a case of CSCWEM and his small group of followers - and if this nomination was accepted it would set a very worrying precedent.'''Neutral''' Not a strong reflection on the candidate, but I still have a bad taste about RfA number 2 -- perhaps because I just found out about it ten minutes ago.  Anyway, I can't support so soon after that very, very bad thing, although I realize CSCWEM isn't wholly responsible for it.  I might have weakly opposed if Massive hadn't done me a favor, as I really don't think this should be unanimous in the aftermath of that, either.'''Strong Support''' as nom. Beaten again, argh!

Everyone makes mistakes and to condemn a former admin for his past mistakes incessantly would really demoralize any Wikipedian. I acknowledge that he had made mistakes in the past. Does that mean that he will never be able to gain his adminship for the resr of his time being spent in this project. Moreover, he is very, very unlikely to repeat those mistakes. If we disallow a former admin from ever gaining his admin duties because of past mistakes, every administrator in this project will be living in constant fear of erring due to some reasons. Just look at [[User:Chacor|Chacor's]] (formarly NSLE) past contributions as a case in point. We as Wikipedians must learn to forgive, although I do not necessary mean forget, one's behaviour in this project. Yes, the user's violations of policy is inexcusable, but is it unforgivable?

If the candidate would offer a good response to (Optional) question from Mike Christie above, I might change my view on this.'''Oppose''': Having read up on the situation, I just can't justify supporting. It's nothing I have against this editor, but as many have already observed, he hasn't shown any remorse for his actions. I don't believe that merely "doing time", so to speak, is enough for one to earn back trust; one really needs to actually show that one regrets what one has done and that one won't do it again.''' Oppose''' Running OrphanBot is excellent work and is of huge benefit to the encyclopedia, and can still be done as an non-admin. However, the main issue is one mentioned by most of the other opposes. Even a "gross error of judgement" is forgivable, but for it to be so, there has to be confidence that the person who committed the error actually realises it was an serious error. Without that, we are simply risking the same errors happening again. Unfortunately, I do not have that confidence, the lack of response noted by others, and the unreplied question by Mike Christie in this rfa, all worry me. In short, excellent contributer, with very useful work with the bot, but not suitable for the sysop bit at this time. Regards,'''Oppose''' per Agent 86 and Bishonen. I think his work on images is admirable, but largely can be done as a non-admin. A response to #4 above, or a pledge to ''only'' work on image-related matters, might allow me to change my mind, but for now I am firm. -- '''''Weak Oppose'''. I've been holding back from this one until now to see if Q4 would get a response, or to see if anyone else has provided any evidence at all of a recognition from Carnildo that he did something wrong. Had there been a recognition of mistakes made, then I'd be quite happy to consider supporting this RFA, I certainly believe in second chances. However, I see nothing from the candidate (only the opinions of others) that suggests a similar incident won't happen again. I certainly am not opposing because of the image work as some others are.'''Oppose'''. It is true that one infraction can be forgiven. But it can't be forgiven if the infractor doesn't get that it was an infraction. With no apparent rememdy to the disconnect in understanding that gave rise to the whole thing, I can't support re-adminning the candidate. This does not disrespect his editorial work, but I am not lent the confidence I need to have a hand in dispensing a sysop bit here. We've had our finger toasted before by re-sysopping the de-sysopped, and it's a mistake we should avoid making again. -'''Strong Oppose''', after the answer to Q4. Every piece of kudos and praise that can be heaped upon Carnildo for his work with OrphanBot is highly deserved - magnificent work. His answer to Q1 indicates that his sysop activities would be restricted to dealing with image issues flagged up by OrphanBot. Normally that would  not be a problem for me - a single focus admin (dealing mainly with one particular realm) is possibly even a good thing. For me, the problem is that admins inevitably get drawn into many other areas on WP. Carnildo's answer to Q4 troubles me greatly. It cedes no recognition to the gravity with which his previous "transgression" was viewed by the community. My summation of this answer, from the language used, is along the lines of ... "I made a mistake, I e-mailed some friends to say so, it's no big deal - get on with it, I've been busy." Please correct me if I'm wrong with this summation Carnildo, and expand as need be, This answer suggests to me a disregard for community opinion, that important lessons have not been learned, and future problems will probably ensue as you get drawn, inevtably, into WP areas outside OrphanBot's remit.

There are other solutions, e.g. the modern theories could go in an article called "Modern theories of natural selection". There seems to have been an insistence, however, that one way was the right way. This does lend some credence to Ted's objections as above.

That was, of course, though an unnecessary move, something that had good results in that you now get to the article by using either spelling, but that isn't the reason Olessi offered for the move and didn't factor into his intentions at all. The problem is also exemplified by the rush to add diacritics to various [[Jizera]]-related articles without a sound basis for doing so, though in Olessi's favor he did change them afterwards.

I do not doubt her competence or trustworthiness at all (I'd be crazy to), but I do wonder how becoming an admin will compromise those traits that have made her, rightfully, the only Wikipedian that has her own fan club. The fact that she is using a reduced version of her lovely signature on this page (so as not to disturb the signature police, maybe?) somewhat worries me in this regard. Phaedriel has demonstrated herself as being capable of so much, both from an editing standpoint with her portals and wikiproject she has started, to her incredible interpersonal skills. I just think, with all that, why bog her down with the tedious and menial tasks of adminship that will occupy her attention and divert her from the truly great things she can offer the project? I really believe that if a user like Phaedriel is going to contribute to the "greater good" here at Wikipedia, it's not going to have much to do with her protecting pages, deleting vanity pages, and applying blocks to vandals -- she has advanced far beyond that. Furthermore half of "adminship" is really about the elevated status you receive. Phaedriel, as an ordinary editor, has achieved a level of community acceptance and respect that far surpasses what the "admin" label affords, so it's not as though the passing of this RfA will change anything in that regard. Besides, it's always really nice, especially as a non-admin and probably for new users as well, to see that a non-admin can carry just the same "weight" around here (if not more) that an admin does. Finally, before I get a barrage of angry comments, obviously this preceding comment is made with the full recognition that this RfA will pass by a record-setting landslide and my intention is not to hinder that with this vote  - just adding my two cents as the process permits and encourages. — ''How can I not support?

I could be convinced otherwise by stories from others of working out problems with a reasonable and calm attitude, but my own limited experience with this editor has been fairly testy (for example, he reverted a change I made to the content of an article with "''rvv''" in the edit summary, despite the fact that I had left the rationale behind what I was doing in my edit summary [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tecumseh%27s_curse&diff=27008649&oldid=26441843]).  That, actually, was one of the few edit summaries he left on an article I was looking at — most of them appear to have no edit summary at all, something particularly important when you're making changes that other people might disagree with.

But then I am biased on this point, I had [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Lar|4 noms]], including pschemp herself, although her nom didn't bring much new info about me to light, to be sure. Also I don't think that the candidate has a lot of control over conoms. C.f.

Finally, per Journalist, he does not have any formal edits (which may be a lesser concern for me).

Question 3 indicates, I feel, that he is too contentious, but my biggest concern is the answer to question 5.

Following the letter of policy is almost always good, but I fear that an editor with such a straight-jacket view of policy will do the wrong thing (or war with those who are doing the right thing) in the few cases where it's not.

Most relevantly, I am quite confident that Benon is sufficiently possessed of a deliberative demeanor and cordial disposition as to be altogether unlikely to abuse the tools, and I'm relatively confident that his judgment is sufficiently fine that he would not misuse the tools (even avolitionally, e.g., by acting in an area with the workings of which he is less-than-conversant), but I'm not sure that I can reach the latter conclusion with a level of confidence that would permit me to conclude that the net effect on the project of Benon's becoming an admin would be positive (that, after all, is my [[User:Jahiegel/Views on Wikipedia/Requests for adminship|RfA standard]]) to a nearly certain degree, and so I must reprise my [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Benon3]] ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FBenon3&diff=52348620&oldid=52340473 neutral]'', in part in view of the same concern I expressed there, viz., that I do fear that Benon's dyslexia might well tend exorbitantly to encumber his communicating with other editors whom he may, qua admin, encounter, especially in view of the en.Wikipedia community's comprising many non-native [[English language|English]] speakers (of course, given my prolixity, I ought not ever to pronounce as to the parsability of another's prose).'''Support''' I really don't like opposition for editcountitis.  If we can trust him with the tools, why not?'''Oppose''' I am hoping to see candidates with good understanding of policy and procedures. I also like to see strong evidence of effective and supportive user talk. Work on those areas and come back again.'''Oppose''' per the 29 Wikispace edits. WAY too low. Relatively high edits/article doesn't help either improve on the Wikispace edits and try running for adminship again at a later date. --'''Neutral''' per EVula. If he comes back in 3 or so months with more XP in other areas, I will support. ''''''Neutral'''. This is one of those candidates that I sometimes see who I really want to support, but something is missing. In this nominee's case, I think it it the lack of experience beyond editing articles. The candidate's answers to GeeJo's questions are what keep me from endorsing  the nominee. The answers only seem to be half-way there, they don't really tell me what the nominee would do beyond deferring to more experienced admins or mulling it over. I'm still open in this RfA to be persuaded otherwise, but I'll more than likely support should the candidate be re-nominated again in the near future.'''Neutral'''. This candidate has very good skills and has contributed but what makes him better than the countless others that have also written about Norse literature.

I would like to support this user, but I'm not so sure due to the lack of edit summary usage and the lack of participation in AfD's. '''''(Changed from neutral from weak support)'' I have to go with '''Oppose''' here. All my previous concerns still apply, and now there's the answers to questions 5 and 6 to deal with. You want admin tools to "protect and preserve the structure"... from whom? Your answer to question 5 leads me to believe that it's from the people who want to delete some of the categories in your structure, which makes it bad. You can not use admin tools to make things get kept when you want them to. And if you expect that being an admin will give your opinion more weight in CfD, you are sorely mistaken. -'''Neutral''' A really good user who won't abuse the tools but shows little need for the tools.--<font color="#27408B" size="2">'''Kind Regards - ''''''Neutral'''.

However, everything else looks great. - <b>'''Oppose'''. Too difficult to make a good read on someone after only 150 or so edits. Try again after a few thousand.'''Fairly strong oppose''' I rarely oppose at RfA, believing that ''support'' is apporpriate for every user about whom it can safely be said that he/she is likelier to use the tools for good (even if rarely) than for bad.  Here, even as I am confident that the user would not be volitionally disruptive with the admin tools, I have serious questions about the user's sometimes acollaborative disposition (unilateralism in action is, to be sure, an unattractive quality in a prospective admin; admins generally serve only to carry out the wishes of the community, interpreting various discussions in order to ascertain where the consensus lies and ought generally to be ministerial) and in any case about his fitness to use the mop, etc.--either an ignorance of policy or a good-faith belief that one is acting for the betterment of the encyclopedia, notwithstanding that others disagree might well lead to his acting inappropriately/incorrectly.  Finally, I am very concerned about the page moves; setting aside that many were made without any talk page discussion, some surely contravene policy (e.g., [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Middle_Eastern_theatre_of_World_War_I&diff=52821251&oldid=52746189 the pagemove "correction" of "theatre" to "theater"]; the [[WP:MoS|MoS]] cautions against such BE/AE moves).Essentially no involvement in Wikipedia policy or administrative processes. Answer to question one can be copied out of some admin handbook page; it is not the result of being familiar with the processes listed. Egregiously empty ballot-casting in what few AfDs there are. —'''Neutral''' per Seadog.

He does great work, and when he was deadmined he behaved with maturity and professionalism and continued to do great work. Obviously, he is far more effective and useful to all of us as an admin. We've demonstrated that we know how to deadmin people when there is a problem, and he's demonstrated consistency and reliability in the face of the difficulties of being human. However you vote, realize that every day Carnildo spends without the mop is at ''our'' expense, not his. --'''Support''' The incident that led to his desysopping was an anomaly, and everyone involved behaved badly.  I cannot imagine a similarly-charged situation arising again, because everyone has learned lessons from that painful first experience.  Otherwise, Carnildo's work is exceptional, and his adminship is clearly a benefit to Wikipedia.'''Support''' per Gmaxwell. Needs adminship for his invaluable image work. '''''×''''''''Support''' Carnildo was one of the best admins Wikipedia had. He understands policy, does the really dirty work, and takes the crap for it. Just look at his talk page and see how calmly he deals with confused (sometimes hostile) uploaders of images. Most admins simply revert anon edits (wow). Wikipedia would be a much better place if half the admins in that oppose list (some of whom have turned quite disrespectful or ferocious when challenged) were as well-informed in policy and as consistently tactful with dealing with stressful situations as Carnildo. --'''oppose''': This is quite a long explanation of oppose, but it is important it is here where it can be seen. I wonder how many of the support votes above are in fact votes not for Carnildo but votes against Jimbo for having the temerity to seize his encyclopedia and instantly de-sysop Carnildo to prevent a possible major scandal in the press.  Because lets face it that is what happened.  I was one of the three infamous editors who one quiet Sunday evening dared to voice the opinion (my opinion) that paedophiles openly editing was not in the best interests of the encyclopedia. (Full explanation and links here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pedophilia_userbox_wheel_war#Statement_by_Giano]) For that I was without warning indefinitely banned for "hate speech" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Giano_archive_4_%282006%29#Blocked]  I've a lot of friends so the ban lasted about 3 minutes, but Carnildo was wheel waring elsewhere on the subject, Jimbo stepped in an instantly de-sysoped him, and the rest is history.  Except in all that time Carnildo has not once contacted me, expressed remorse,  or even given me explanation of his views.  He would not just be a bad admin, he would be dangerous to the project as a whole.  That he comes here just a few short weeks later just displays his complete lack of understanding of what an admin should be.  Regarding his work with images: there is a widely held misconception on wikipedia that anyone who does seemingly dull work should be rewarded with an adminship -this is not the case.  People only do what they enjoy doing.  No one is asked to do anything, and anyone who expects thanks and great reward here is living in cloud cuckoo land, the same place I hope this attempt to regain admin powers is firmly sent. Incidentally, I am not an admin, have never wanted to be, and considering the standards of behaviour employed by many of them - see no need to be.'''Oppose''' though I wouldn't say "never" and because people do make mistakes and should be given a second chance if they have proved that they corrected their ways.  I'd say an appropriate waiting period would be in order - say, a year.  If you show us for a year that you have turned into a person that can be trusted not to lose his head or abuse sysop powers, then I'll vote for you.  --'''Oppose'''. Not a suitable administrator, as I am not myself. --'''Neutral''' because there are strong arguments both for (forgiveness, that you did what you thought was right for the right reasons) and against (a pretty damning ArbCom finding, using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, reapplying too soon). I think you would have been better off waiting a few months to let memories fade, personally. --'''Neutral''' (moved vote from oppose) I am for giving people another chance, and Carnildo has a stellar track record before the incident in question, not to mention his work with the images. Nonetheless, a little more time is needed to let this situation cool over. He has my unequivocal support in a future nomination. --'''Support'''. Per nom, and per own experiences at various sexuality related topics. --'''Support''' - when people who don't agree with you can nominate you, you're doing something right. --<font color="3300FF">'''Support''' per nom - complete disagreement with political views, agreement over adminship.'''Support''', per nom; they seem to have made quite a number of constructive contributions, and I haven't seen them be anything but civil. <font face="trebuchet ms"><b>'''Oppose''' per polemical user page.  There's a lot that concerns me there, particularly the AGF argument, the lengthy political discourse, and the use of inflammatory userboxes.'''Oppose''' because I think there are several downsides and no upsides to having administrators who are very visibly espousing strongly-held political or religious beliefs, and who focus their Wikipedia contributions on articles in that field. Even though I have no reason to believe that Catamorphism will abuse the admin tools, I imagine readers and new users (who don't really grok Wikipedia yet) will be swift to suspect bias when being confronted with administrative action (no matter how justified) in an article related to Catamorphism's personal views. I'm afraid to say that my one interaction with Catamorphism (on an AfD) doesn't help either; I think his insistence that everyone adjust their language ([[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis|and thus, their personal ideas]] on sex and gender) to accommodate his supposed gender is incivil and reflects an attitude unbecoming an administrator. He has certainly every right to call himself whatever he wants to, but he has no grounds to request that other people (who can see a man's photograph on his user page) call him anything else but the standard English "he". They might do that out of courtesy (or conviction), once they get to know him, but to insist on it reeks of arrogance. Sorry.'''Oppose''' mostly on userpage. Similar reasons to my vote at RfA/Joturner2 - user espouses very controversial beliefs and is a quite bit aggressive about it. ''And zere it iz!'' lol - <b>'''Oppose'''.

Combining the IP evidence with the timing and with other evidence both private and public, and there's simply no way that his denial is even remotely credible.  Sorry, no.  He is quite evidently guilty of the charge that was laid before him.  Really, NSLE, how many supporters do you think Brandt has in Singapore, and what are the odds that one of them (one of an empty set?) would edit his article all of '''seven minutes''' after your unprotect, from the '''same IP''' you used to do the unprotect, with '''no intervening edits''' from that IP, and '''no''' edits from that IP from any user other than BRSG until three minutes after BRSG's last edit at which point you  started editing again?  Your defense of "it was just a coincidence" gets sliced to ribbons by Ockham's Razor.  NSLE's continued refusal to admit his actions -- which wouldn't have been that big of a deal had he admitted them -- proves his unworthiness to be an administrator, especially when combined with all the other faults cataloged above as well.'''Oppose'''.

I find the whole desysop affair bizarre, but I think only two possibilities are reasonable: either NSLE is lying on the sock issue, or Kelly Martin is. I'm inclined to trust Kelly here, seeing as Chacor is prepared to say [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Jaranda2&diff=prev&oldid=60294086 untruths]. If BSRG was his sock, I'm prepared to forgive and forget; but only after an admission of guilt. However, I am ''not'' opposing Chacor due to that event but on his editing since. I feel he gets offended too easily and also seems to [[WP:BITE|bite]] relative newcomers (see [[Talk:Hurricane Kyle (2002)#Todo]]).

I've been troubled by some stuff I've read here about Elonka's vanity edits and some of her previous scrapes but I also have been impressed to learn how much she's contributed. To the extent that she was more of a coordinator/volunteer/cheerleader/taskmaster on the "Lost" category of articles than a solo writer, I see that as a plus, not a negative. I know she has a strong ego (the world needs some of these people) and I trust she'll temper it in the future.

Also, too much ''certainty'' in evidence for my liking. <b>'''Oppose''':  I concur with Danny, but I have noticed that the inappropriate self-valuation has crept into other dealings with users and views on article fitness.'''Strong oppose.''' This is not the person who needs admin power. Repeated violations of Wikipedia policy and guidelines, getting blocked, a vanity page with inappropriate self-promotion, either ignorance of or defiance to project goals, ''removing other people's comments from talk pages!!!'' . . . despite many conscientious contributions, there are too many reasons to withhold admin authority from this individual.'''Switch to oppose''' based on concerns over fiefdom and conflict of interest.'''Oppose''' per Daveydweeb and others.  Simply to much controversy and baggage - baggage that will no doubt cast a (perhaps unfair) shadow on any of her future controversial admin decisions.'''Switch to oppose'''. I was quite worried when I saw [[User:Elonka/CoS|The cone of silence]]. Beyond the fact that it shows behavior (along with the [[WP:AUTO]]) that the user feels herself above the rules, it also brings up an interesting point that I don't think anyone else is mentioned: What supposed problem exists (because Elonka said that it was the solution to a problem) that could merit a secret page inviting personal attacks as the solution? Even if it is just an experiment, it shows the user is putting herself in situations that invite personal attacks. Not a good thing. Again, I want to emphasize that this editor has many valuable contributions, but the suspicion of sock (although more likely meat) puppetry has pushed me over the edge.'''opppose''' as per many above, Bishonen & Bunchofgrapes in particular.'''Neutral''' for now.

I’ve seen him write in a mimic style to a Wikipedia editor (me) in “conceding tone” rather then be helpful and handle a situation matter-of-factly.  His interaction with me wasn’t helpful but tended to escalate a situation rather then to deescalate it.  I would think this is a grave concern that this type of emotional and impulsive personality profile would have ADMIN powers.  He may well be a good ADMIN later, but for now I think he needs to work on his style of communication and constructive skills. Example: Such statements, ''With people reverting edits that YOU made to YOUR userpage then maybe YOU shouldn't edit it as an IP" and "What the hell are you talking about?'' I also do not think ILovePlankton has a clear understanding of policies.  My page was blanked after I made a very favorable edit on my USER page and forgot to sign in.  The edit only showed an IP.  Judgment would dictate it was a positive and favorable edit and that perhaps the USER forgot to sign in.  But his way to handle the situation was to take sides and state:  ‘’“With people reverting edits that YOU made to YOUR userpage then maybe YOU shouldn't edit it as an IP"’’ and this in your face tone won’t be that productive on Wikipedia. I think it's not the quantity of the edits he has made but the quality of the edits that are most important, that is "especially" in situations when emotions are escalating. In my view his condescending tone is the worst part of it.  I think if he were to work on not being condescending that would a great start.  Maybe an ADMIN later, but I think, again, he needs to develop his skills on handling adverse situations and show a more objective view frist.  But then again, this is only my opinion, and I am sure the powers that be will look into for themselves and make their own conclusions.'''Oppose''' per the above; not confident of this user's maturity and understanding of the project.'''Oppose'''.

I'd like to see another few months of solid editing before I'd consider supporting. --'''Support'''. In the past I have not felt ready to support Jaranda, primarily because of communications issues.  I have followed his progress and I believe he has earned my support.  I'll admit that I cringe a little when he announces that he is leaving, but taking a break is exactly what he should be doing in those instances, though more quietly and with less finality.  The bottom line, however, is that I think he knows the role of an admin and will handle the job appropriately. --'''Oppose''' per Lord Bob (thanks for the diffs!!). Jaranda has improved the communication problems mentioned last time around, which I applaud. But his responses to stress, his frequent threats (?) to leave Wikipedia, his claims of being "hooked" on Wikipedia, etc., all lead me to oppose. The candidate says he wants to "use adminship powers in a non-burnout way" but I am not confident that he has the judgement to stay away from that kind of trouble.'''Oppose''' (changed from neutral).  Adminship is not a trophy and I just think this user has not demonstrated the temperament needed for an admin.  I'm also concerned about the response to Titoxd's question below (NLSE #5).  The rambling reply talks about "try to stop and prevent it if I become a admin" and "I am going to have a no tolerance policy on heavy wheel warning" without any indication of what concrete actions this implies.  It makes me think this admin would tend to act first and think later, so I am reluctantly opposing. —'''Oppose''' (moved from neutral). The more I watch this, the more I realize I still don't want Jaranda to be an admin. He seems to really want adminship as a trophy, but hasn't shown yet that he could handle the stress. I really admire his recent contributions, and this is what made me vote neutral, but I realized that I ''was'' letting adminship be a trophy for good contributions, by balancing his good contributions against my doubt that he could handle being an admin. If he can take a rest from RfAs for 4 months or so and maintain his good contributions, then I'll be more convinced.'''Neutral''' - Somehow, although a neutral vote doesn't count for or against, I think it's right for me to positively vote neutral. Admin status shouldn't be seen as a trophy, although it seems to be seen that way by most people who visit this page, including Jaranda. -'''Neutral'''. I think you've probably been around "long enough", but I share some of the above concerns that you are not really familiar with the nuts and bolts of Wikipedia.

This user is interested in deletion tasks by the look of it--not vandal fighting--so I think that should be kept in mind when evaluating this RfA. I know that an admin has a wide range of responsibilities, and it seems as though most opposition stems from answers to the blocking questions. I don't think there is anything within the user's past edit history (or within said answers) though, to indicate anything but a calm and fair temperment applied to what ''little'' blocking Jc37 is likely to be doing.'''Support'''.

As for his userpage, it seems a little excessive (though not much) but it's mostly his actions that count in my book.  I don't subscribe to the view that we need more Muslim admins though (maybe more Muslim editors, but admins are supposed to serve the community  not impose their views).  Who I think we need as admins (and I believe largely have) are reasonable people like Joturner.  Good Luck.'''Late Support'''; User page certainly now seems balanced (and quite beautiful), and user has been impressively fair and level headed with regards this RFA, although a wider edit spectrum would be nice.'''Strong Oppose'''. I opposed last time because I disagreed with the approach he had taken to some edits and because he had made a mess out of some AfD noms. The user page, which looked like this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Joturner&oldid=43812990] at the time, was not a big factor for me. It seemed a bit over the top to me then, but within acceptable boundaries. However, this user has updated his user page and the new page, I believe, has crossed the line into a level of activism that has no place here. Statements like "''Terrorism should be removed from vocabulary''" or "''A nation will meet its doomsday not long after it begins to forsake the right to privacy and the right to equal treatment. The United States is unfortunately starting to do that in the name of the War on Terror''" are too ideological. An admin needs to be an impartial referee and I no longer believe this user can play that role. I previously felt that Joturner needed more time before becoming an admin. I still think that more time is required. --'''Oppose''', my earlier [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Joturner&diff=45241579&oldid=45241087 concerns] are still relevant.

Moving contended text to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Joturner/The_Full_Path subpage] doesn't help. Asking for a review of one's own user page, editing it to improve chances for a RfA and moving one's editing focus away from Islam as announced, contrary to stated interests, just to further one's RfA, strikes me as bewildering. I don't trust that zeal. --'''Weak Oppose''' Actually a very good editor, but the embers from his last RfA is yet to cool down. It is barely 2 months since his last RfA.

Kafziel is a very intelligent Wikipedian who has an aptitude to handle extremely complicated situations on Wikipedia. His approach may appear superficially polarizing, but there is a clean underlying logic to it.

I'd encourage a closer look at his collaborations, as well as his other archives. Full support. --'''Oppose''': discussion of this adminship has made way out into Talk pages, and this whole RfA seems more like a political race where Kafziel is trying to appease everyone with answers that don't always seem to be in agreement with one another. This, in my strongest of opinions, is not what Wikipedia ought to be.Oppose. I had some doubts earlier about experience with process other than AFD, but there are simply too many users here concerned about combativeness. ('''Oppose''' per above.  Candidate probably would make a good admin but it's clear that there are a number of people that I respect who think Kafziel needs to adjust his combative and biting tone.  Recall and ARBCOM are "sledgehammers" to deal with egregious behavior.  The RFA is our last chance to make a point about undesirable behavior which is something less than "a federal case".  Kafziel doesn't seem to have gotten the point that the opposers are making so let's have him think about it awhile between now and his next RFA.  --'''Neutral''' from previous support. As much as I'd like to support you, civility is a fundamental aspect of adminship, and based on the concerns above I don't believe you meet the standard I expect from candidates. I won't oppose, since it's clear enough you're competent and experience enough for the job; however, administrators of all users must take ''extreme'' care to always be civil to users even under fire, and so I cannot bring myself to support.

You do not deserve an oppose opinion due to your excellent contributions to this project, but I can't support your nomination for the time being. But please do not get discouraged over this.

However, recent activity has been full of conflict--including a bout with Jimbo, of all people.  The "manifesto" and Wikipedia Review post are also highly questionable, and his ArbCom candidacy was run with a platform advocating sweeping changes.  My advice?  Don't try to revolutionise Wikipedia.  Don't try to fight everything.  It's not worth it, your editing has suffered and, surely, it can't be much fun for you either.  Come back to being the productive, fun, and well-respected editor you were circa September of last year, and after things have cooled down, you'll get your adminship back.'''Neutral'''.

You seem like a good editor, but the fact that you have requested adminship roughly every 3 months (and each one being a self-nomination) over the past year, starting from when you had been here just a few months, seems to be an indication that you still have a ways to go as an editor.  You have about 1700 edits, and a cursory look at the most recent ones seems to indicate that they were minor tweaks to the same few articles.  In this same cursory look, I couldn’t find many instances of the vandal-fighting you say that you want the admin tools for.  However – a few positives – your edit summary usages have much improved since your previous RfAs, and your edits are nicely distributed.  I would suggest waiting a good 6 months before you try this again – and in that time, edit more frequently and do more vandal-fighting.  It would help to get someone else to nominate you for adminship, as well.  Right now I don’t see any compelling evidence that you would abuse the admin tools, but I don’t seen any compelling evidence that you need them, either.  You can still be an excellent editor without the mop :).'''Oppose''', low edit count and experience, please wait for a longer time and try again in future.

All of these will add value to the project and raise your profile amongst your peers, making a future RfA nomination much more likely to result in a successful outcome. 2-3000 edits seems to be an unofficial minimum for editors to demonstrate some or all of the above.

I think MER-C has great potential for the future but to date has been too fast to delete too many times. [[User:Cynical|Cynical's]] highlighting (just above) of his response to Q.4 tipped my decision. I think [[WP:IAR]] should be the answer to "when all else fails ...", (i.e., existing policies and guidelines, forged by consensus, somehow fail to address a situation). WP:IAR should not be used to instead override the community consensus embedded in all this guidance. Furthermore, CSD is a potentially dangerous tool and if there is any possibility any 3rd, uninvolved editor might reasonably think an article should be kept, MER-C should use PROD. PROD is always a better choice for those articles on the borderline of CSD. I encourage MER-C to learn from this RfA, go back to the drawing board, and build a strong track record of more judicious deletions for a few months; I'd be happy to support a second RfA then. I also recommend he actually make substantive additions to some articles. Even if MER-C then never edits again, at least he will better understand other editors' thought processes and values before pulling the trigger. Several hours worth of article-building followed by reversion or speedy deletion engenders empathy for other editors and a sense of personal humility. --'''Support'''.

First, the diff provided by Crzrussian shows a lack of understanding of very basic notability policies.  For those unfamiliar with Gaelic football and it's representation on Wikipedia, playing in the All-Ireland Cup is a very big deal. While the sport and its athletes are undercovered on Wikipedia, there are at least 100 articles on footballers and managers.  What's more is that Seán O'Brien was already on Wikipedia as a redlink [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_GAA#Cork_Gaelic_Football_Squad here].  This is especially concerning if the user wants to use the admin buttons to deal with the CSD backlog and close AfD's.  Also, half of the candidate's edits have  been made in the past month.

I was going to Moral Support but I can't see anyway to justify that position. I urge the candidate to withdraw this nomination and I would say come back in a year or perhaps even 18 months.

I have run across a few admins who abuse their power and i honestly believe that RGTraynor would in no way do this. I have been following his edits for almost a year now, and he has given no indication of being the kind of editor who would abuse his powers.

I am impressed by the progress made since previous nomination which I opposed. This is an experienced editor who I do not think would abuse admin powers.Missed this nom... but '''support'''.  Serious and trustworthy user.  And the opposes on the grounds of "not enough edit summaries" baffle me... adminship should be no big deal; and not a style-guide quiz.  If this one fails, I hope Alkivar is renom'ed in less than three months.'''Oppose''' edit summaries, lack thereof; RFA voting patterns, whilst on the platform Alkivar has supported most of the current candidates, but in the recent past has opposed other candidates — my conclusion is that he is buttering up the other candidates so they will support him. --'''Neutral, but with a comment'''.  Alkivar opposed my own [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/RoySmith|RfA]] not long ago.  He certainly has the right to vote against me, and I don't hold that against him (which is why this is a neutral), but I found his reason for opposing me rather silly.  His objection was that I didn't have a high enough edit count at the time.  It seems like a very mechanical way to go about making decisions.  I think we want admins who exercise good judgement, not those who add up numbers and see if they exceed some magic threshold or not.  Looking over his contribs, I see things like many (I didn't count, but it's probably over 100) edits to [[List of units using the B-26 Marauder during World War II]] during a week or so this October.  It certainly gets his edit count up, but in what way does it prepare him for being an admin?   --'''Strong support'''. The ''only'' reason I'm not up there at #2 is waiting for my own RfA to finish. The sooner Android79 is an admin, the better for us all. -'''Support'''.  Add me to the "I thought he already was one" list.  --'''Support'''. I think it would be a shame to lose him for some minor mistakes which he will very quickly learn to avoid.  I believe we need as many multi-lingual and multi-cultural wikipedians on english wikipedia as we can get.  The fact he is already an admin bodes well.--'''Weak Support'''. The only big problem is the lack of edit summaries, otherwise I agree with [[User:Silversmith|Silversmith]]. The benefit of multi-lingual and multi-cultural admins is that they can help coordinate and manage the translations of various articles across the different wikis.'''Support'''.  The user explained perfectly clearly his lack of project edits--he is only requesting admin privileges for one specific function.  He's obviously trustworthy, and he does indeed need to be an admin to perform the current events archiving, so I don't see the problem here.'''Support''', clearly a "trusted user" who could make a more effective contribution with the admin tools.

Excellent contributor, fast vandal fighter. And oh what a fight it's been recently. --<s>I spent about 10 minutes sifting through Clarkk's talk page and contributions.  One thing that struck me was the percentage of his edits that are minor, most of which being recats. I'd say 80% of his edits are minor, and this can inflate one's edit count. This is not a reason to oppose however.  I do see good things from this contributor and he seems very civil. I agree with a lot of the advice he gives contributors. Also, I'm not questioning his experience, being on wikipedia for almost a year, he knows what's going on.  What I'm mainly concerned about is his narrow scope of editing.  It seems like most of what he does is recat, or fix errors pertaining to the small slice of Australia related articles. He does some good work on Australian suburbs but he hasn't in a while.  I just think he could broaden his scope and contribute more to other areas of Wikipedia. What's keeping me from voting to support is wondering what he would do with his admin powers. How would he use them? Why would they benefit the work he has already done now? Perhaps when Clarkk answers the candidate questions below I'll get a better idea and possibly change my vote to support. &mdash; <font color="#cc0000">''oo64eva (Alex)'' </font><sup>('''Support'''.

Ramallite's [[User talk:Ramallite|talk page]], along with the fact that several people who disagreed with him previously are now supporting him, show that this is a user who is capable of constructively discussing controversal issues --'''support''' Usually I would vote neutral due to insufficient edit count (my rule-of-thumb being at 1500-2000). What is swaying me is (a) support from people I respect, (b) the support he is getting ''from the 'other camp' '', so to speak, something all too rarely seen in Israeli-Palestinian affairs, and (c) the fact that I wish to set a counter-weight to what I consider unfounded oppose votes below.'''Support'''. Many difficult topics suffer from a lack of disinterested people who can edit and administrate in a way that works towards consensus. I hope that Ramallite can help the project. -'''Support'''.  Looking at Ramallite's history, I think he will use the tools wisely.  While I might like to see a little more Wikispace participation, his work on "New Pages" and "Recent Changes" doesn't make him any less worthy than editors who have a large number of edits on AfD.  There are lots of different needs here and no one needs to try to cover everything. --'''Oppose''' - POV issues, unexperienced - needs more time to prove himself before he should be considered for admin. I'm also skeptical because there appear to be many POV pushers and persons who are prone to cliqueish admin behavior supporting him. Admins should have proven adherence to consensus building and neutrality in disputes, and many giving testimony in support do not have those qualities.'''Support''', has the busiest talk page I've ever seen, almost all with praise and thanks for welcomes.'''Support'''; I've just started noticing him recently, and he's a superb candidate.'''Support'''.

Obviously, a lot of great spelling/syntax [[Special:Contributions/Sam Hocevar|work]], (which, based on edit times, I suspect may be at least partially script-assisted), but Sam's ''connections'' to (and perhaps even ''admiration'' of) the GNAA seem quite real, and a number of his non-spelling related edits are worrisome, such as where he reverted [[User:Natalinasmpf|Natalinasmpf]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:JacksonBrown&diff=prev&oldid=18730376 here], and where he had this [http://zoy.org/~sam/hello.jpg link] to a "furry" image on his user page, (indeed, he has place a number of not-clearly-marked links within pages in his own namespace that don't seem entirely appropriate to me, even if he was demonstrating what he called a "proof of concept"). I also don't see many edits in the Wikipedia namespace, outside of things like [[Wikipedia:Chess championship]]. In short, I'm not sure that he has what I think of as the appropriate qualifications for adminship on .en.I am extremely uncomfortable about supporting the adminship of someone with such a close connection to the [[Gay Nigger Association of America|GNAA]].  Additionally, if the examples Silsor cites had been more recent, this would be a strong oppose vote, because trolling is completely unacceptable for someone who represents Wikipedia as a sysop.  However, ten months is a relatively long time (on the internet at least), so I'm '''neutral'''. --<s>'''Support''', I have been seeing positive contributions from this editor for a long time, and it is of my belief that he will make good use of sysop rights.

I am assuming, though, that this will never come into the way of his judgment, thus I vote Support. --[[User:Sn0wflake|Sn0wflake]] 18:00, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</s> '''Abstain''', but I will be clear in stating that it has been made clear to all that [[User:Silsor]] is the troll himself here. The information he brought to this request for adminship should be ultimately regarded as [[flamebait]]. Thus, for all purposes, I abstain not out of trust for Hocevar, whom has been upfront about the issue and has proven to have essentialy positive intentions, but as a partial crictic to his connections to the GNAA. Said group, despite whatever relative merits might have in Hocevar's view, have been known Wikipedia trolls. I hope this nomination passes - as it surely will - and that Hocevar joins the Wikipedia team of admins, as it is only fair. --'''Support''' &mdash; Sango123 is not only a great artist (both in Barnstars and [[WP:MIND]]), but also a great [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]] who would make a great admin.

I am particularly mystified by suggestions that his recent break should in any way be counted against him—the guy has made 17,000 non-harmful edits, and in my book he's perfectly entitled to take a break for personal reasons momentarily. The only possible area of concern is his extremely limited participation in the WP namespace, involvement in which often indicates interest and familiarity with the workings of WP and related policy matters which are important for admins. However his positive attributes and obvious good sense convince me that he'll spend the necessary time to learn up these things before employing any new buttons he might receive.'''Support''' Nice range of activity, great example for other potential nominees.'''Support.''' The only important criteria for an admin is trustworthiness in following policies and improving the place. The answers below are impressive, and in comparison the objections are minor.

I was one of those that offered a year ago to nominate Badger, and I stand by that 100%.  Badger is a fantastic editor and contributor--I understand that the focus these days is on new admins who will do work on Wikipedia upkeep projects, but back in the old days if we had a good editor who contributed a lot to the project and didn't cause trouble, I recall us giving them admin privileges if they wanted them.  I can foresee only benefits if we give Badger admin privileges--if for no other reason (and I can think of many others) than that a user who has made as many good, well-written, high-quality contributions to this project as Badger has deserves to have that recognized.  Adminship is supposed to be "no big deal"--in a perfect world, all wiki users would have admin privileges.  We restrict them because there are people who will abuse the privileges -- I can't believe there's any concern about Badger in that respect.  Sorry for the long note, but I've been wanting to nominate this editor for a year, and I can't believe there are so many oppose votes right now.'''Neutral''', I like SB but he doesn't have enough interaction for adminship.

I'm ''deeply'' unhappy that you sysopped yourself today for no good reason in a completely non-emergency situation. It feels like having realised that being an admin is fun, thought you'd do the process retrospectively. That doesn't show the good judgement I'd like, I'm afraid. And there seems to be a little bit of immodesty, too, in your comment below, although you wouldn't be the only admin with that problem. (Minor point, but devs of all people shouldn't be transcluding signatures.) -My impression of Avar is that he often acts on impulse, without considering the consequences of his actions, which is not a desirable trait in an administrator.  Regardless of his motives for these image deletions, he did (as I understand it) delete several images which were being used in articles, creating a significant amount of work for other people who had to restore these images from archives, or find replacements.  His mass deletion of anon talk pages seems somewhat strange; I could understand a proposal to delete, or perhaps blank, old anonymous users' talk pages, but wholesale deletion of them seems somewhat excessive--particularly since Avar only touched pages which he himself had edited.   Furthermore, I felt Avar's block of'''Oppose''', reluctantly. I like Ævar as a person, but he seems to be prone to acting rashly at times.'''Oppose'''.  For the most part, I'm totally baffled by what happened with his de-sysoping, even after reading through the old logs, but I'd want to see evidence of good behavior in the recent past.  Re-sysopping himself is definitely not a good sign of that.  Given his disregard for other processes in the past and GDFL concerns with images, I would expect more caution from him.  I'd recommend that he reapply after a few months of good behavior.  --'''Oppose'''An admin ''must'' be polite and calm at all times.'''Strong Oppose''' per the fact that I hate Sockpuppetry and the tone of the response made on the afd mentioned were completely unacceptable for an admin, regardless of how you feel about the words "Deletionist" or "Inclusionist"(I agree with [[User:Tony Sidaway|Tony Sidaway]] on that argument, by the way, and have a similiar view with editcountitis).I'll support, based on contributions.

A user since Nov, with lots of minor edits and self-nommed twice already... just seems to me like the user is a little ''too'' eager to get into adminship.  I don't know why, and I'm still assuming good faith, but that plus the sockpuppet accusation prevents me from casting a support at this time.'''Neutral'''. Too soon, too soon. Everything else says "yes", but not yet. If this fails, try again after October 23, and things will be different.'''Oppose''' <strike>Please review [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Standards|unofficial standards]] and re-apply in 2-3 months.  --[[User:Rogerd|rogerd]] 04:49, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</strike> User is clearly not even close to being ready for adminship --'''Oppose'''- 1000 edits overall, less than 500 to article namespace. In my opinion, not yet experienced enough to be an administrator.  Sorry. --'''Oppose''': not enough experience, no serious answers to questions for candidate, vandalism, possibly sock puppet.Needs more experience. First edit was only about 7 weeks ago. Looks to be a good start though.Sorry, but I don't think someone who calls people who disagree with him "morons" in an edit summary [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Niger_Innis&diff=11314263&oldid=11314171] will make a good administrator.  Perhaps in time (that edit is only three days old), but I can't support currently.I've seen him get pretty worked up on VfDs that he disagreed with and insult the nominators. Seems like a good guy otherwise, if he calms down a bit maybe I'll support.Definitely he's done some good work, but I've had enough poor experience in dealing with him that I have to oppose for now.I like that he supports an [[Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship|appropriate procedure for de-adminship]].  I'll move to support if he stops [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages#Things to avoid|transcluding his signature]] with a /sig (which is worse than an image in some respects). --'''Support''', good and hardworking user. Not a great diplomat, but I believe he has learned a lot from the conflicts he's been in, and will be a better admin for them.I gotta vote no. If you go to his talk page, he literally told someone to "bite me" about a week ago. And looking at his other edits, I still see a short fuse. --This user removes vandalism a lot. As an admin they could help more by banning users that continue to vandalise. --'''Strong Oppose''' Clearly Don't like the answers for 5 and 6. I dont trust this user with AFDs --'''Oppose'''.  If a user wants to start a debate over policy (such as AfD), they should do so in a talk forum, not by trying to become and admin and unilaterally implementing a new policy themselves. The discretion given to admins on things like AfD closings, blockings, and speedy deletions is on a ''case by case'' basis, to keep Wikipedia running smoothly; as reactions to previous incidents have shown, it would be an abuse of administrator powers to use them in an effort to spark or influence policy debates. From the answers below, I think that is what this user intends to do. --'''Neutral''' - Looks like a good candidate but can't have much experience with AfD or policy discussion as if he did, he would know the lack of consensus to delete school articles. Would someone please twist my arm? --[[user:Celestianpower|Cel]]<font color=green>[[WP:ESP|e]]</font>'''Neutral''' -- Aranda56 is a great user, and will definately make a good admin some day. While I'm not much on edit counts or time since arrival as an indicator of an editor's readiness for adminship, I think a few more edits and a few more weeks would be of benefit. Don't lose heart, JAranda, and don't let this slow you down; rack up more edits and a bit more time, come back, and you'll have my full support. --'''Oppose''': Today, he removed a number of red links from [[List of male singers]] (example [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_male_singers&diff=prev&oldid=27147781]). Some of these were people who are linked from a number of articles. For example, removing [[Mark Murphy]]. Doing a quick google test for "Mark Murphy" and jazz returns 98,300 hits ([http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22Mark+Murphy%22+jazz&btnG=Google+Search]). Another removal of a red link ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Default&diff=prev&oldid=26276276]) was to a perfectly valid term in tennis. There's a reason for red links; they help show what articles are most needed (see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Red Link Recovery|Red Link Recovery]],  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Most_wanted_articles#General]). Removing these links can actually disrupt Wikipedia. Placing this in juxtaposition of the [[Rod Strickland]] article created by you with redlinks ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rod_Strickland&diff=prev&oldid=26279859]), your handling of redlinks seems very unusual, and perhaps too casual. I am also concerned about the removal of [[Abdul Kalam]] from [[21st century]] labeled as "Reverted POV" in edit summary ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=21st_century&diff=prev&oldid=26240043]). This person is the president of the 2nd largest (by population) country in the world. I have a hard time understanding how inclusion on a list of influential people in politics could be considered POV pushing. Dr. Kalam is still missing from that list. More care in deletions is needed; your impact here was negative and ongoing. There's also a curious deletion of content on the [[Nelly]] article ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelly&diff=prev&oldid=26224711]). The edit summary says only "revert". The content deleted is very similar to the line right above it in the version where it was not yet deleted ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelly&diff=prev&oldid=26223194]). On what grounds did you delete the content? I also have some mild objections to improper stub sorting ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Girvan_Dempsey&diff=prev&oldid=26313685], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kelly_%28U.S._politician%29&diff=prev&oldid=27022545]) which was later corrected by others ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Girvan_Dempsey&diff=next&oldid=26313685], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kelly_%28U.S._politician%29&diff=next&oldid=27022545]), and improper speedy tagging of [[Lenny and Squiggy]] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lenny_and_Squiggy&oldid=26314158]) which I feel was premature, and was corrected a few hours later ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lenny_and_Squiggy&diff=26324526&oldid=26314158]). If you're not familiar with a topic, you should be careful before tagging it, much less speedy deleting it. Any of these things by themselves would not be sufficient for me to vote oppose. But, taken as a whole, I feel there is a pattern of behavior that shows the nominee to be too quick to judge, and less careful than needed for an administrator. I do feel the nominee's heart is in the right place. Given improvement in carefulness of their approach to deletions of articles and content and a few months time, I may be inclined to support. --'''Neutral'''.  I initially supported, since he is very good at fighting vandals, but I'm changing my vote in keeping with how I have voted on previous multiple self-noms.  While he is a good editor, I think that multiple self-nominations (plus similar wording among them) show that he might be too eager for adminship. --Now, if I call ''proper spelling'' "the submission to the tyranny of tradition", I wonder how many would still rate it so highly. &mdash; <small>'''support''' he really removes a lot of the vandalism on here so we should help him with the rollback tool'''Support'''.  Can use some maturity, but so can we all.  Dedicated vandalism-fighter who needs the tools.  --Neutral : I have no opinion on this user as an admin in general. I would like to point out that bad grammar and spelling is not so important to an encyclopedia as it is to a dictionary. In an encyclopedia it's more important to get the facts right, than it is to get the spelling of those facts right. :-P'''Support'''. (This page also has a [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Babajobu|talk page]].) --I generally expect users to have 1,200 edits before requesting adminship, but I can be flexible. 1166 edits is good enough. And I like his work. --Maybe after more edits. <span class="internal" title="View my user page" style="white-space: nowrap;">--I am uncertain to vote either way.  His praises have some merit, but the caution urge from others certain has me concern.  I think I slightly agree with the fact that this request for adminship comes premature.  I do not wish to discourage either way, therefore I wish to remain neutral. --'''Oppose'''. Ok this turned into quite the speech, but I want to be clear on my reasoning. My general baseline is four months and 2,000 edits. However, I'm willing to bend that in cases where one of those being stronger makes up for one being less, particularly on the time side, or in cases where I know the user well enough to get a sense of their suitability. However, I have not had any opportunity to interact with you, and I generally am strongly disinclined to support with anything less than 1,000 edits. Considering that that number is also over a year-long period, that shows a level of participation that I do not think is enough for adminship. Part of why I feel that way is I am concerned that with infrequent participation, you may not be able to keep up with policy. This came up in another user's RfA recently, and in that case I felt confident with both that user's participation level and attention level to policy. However, I note a couple things in your RfA: First, you use the term "Votes for Deletion". VfD has in the past few months been re-named "Articles for Deletion". I myself am still getting used to that change, but I have a hard time being convinced you will be able to know policy well with that kind of error. Second, your user signature does not seem to link to your user page. I believe it is important for an admin to have a clear signature that easily links to both their user and talk pages, to facilitate communication. Third, you describe in your answers to the questions below that you would attempt to resolve disputes off-site. I question the wisdom of this. One of the advantages that we have with the wiki process is that ''everything'' is completely transparent. Nothing that we do on this site is hidden, and every edit, comment, and action is reviewable, and for the most part, reversable. If you attempt conflict resolution offsite, there is absolutely no evidence of what transpired. Having that evidence is helpful in that it may serve to protect you, should you be wrongly accused of mis-action by another user. Also, in your introduction, you state that you have more edits than you can count, which in my first read made me think that you were claiming to have a large edit count, however that is not the case. I am sure that was not intentional, but I want you to be aware of the impression that I got. I'm sorry this is such a soapbox, but I like to be clear in my reasoning. I hope that you will continue to provide an excellent contribution to the project. Best regards,'''Support''', good editor, understands NPOV, head seems firmly screwed to neck.-'''Support''', I like his idea of exploiting the time zone advantage to revert vandalism. I will support again if his 'inexperience' makes the community withhold consensus now.'''Neutral''' great editor, but I'm not sure you'd be a great admin at the moment.'''Strong oppose'''. Fails to answer nomination questions, too few edits and obviously not well-versed in wikipedia policies and janitorial tasks.'''Oppose''': Only 3% of the user's edits are outside of user and article name spaces. Lack of contribution in other namespaces is problematic. Uses edit summaries just 22% of the time. I like to see a minimum of >80% and prefer 90%. --'''Oppose''' More community interaction is needed for successful use of admin powers.'''Conditional Support'''. Bobblewik, my hat off to you to making a huge dent in the 'pedia! However, I will only support you if you are a little more cautious in your edits (see Klonimus' oppose vote). However, in the spirit of the Wiki, I will [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|assume good faith]] and give you my support! [[User:Linuxbeak|Linuxbeak]] |'''Oppose''' Bobblewik changes units for fields which he knows little about.  In [[Town Gas]] he changed the normal units for expressing the caloric value of a gas (Btu/scf (Btu per standard cubic foot) to MJ/m3 which is not the industry or common use standard. As well some the conversions got garbled resulting in the some of the information in the article now being incorrect. I appreactie the spellchecking and cleanups, but not the metrification campaign. Certain encyclopedia subjects use units that are metric but not SI, or conventional, or even a mixture (I.e canning/autoclaving, 121*C at 15psi pressure).  that needs to be resepected, and not clobbered.'''Oppose''', Boothy wants to oppose all of us, let us return the favor.'''Nuhu, no way, no how''' Hell is still hot as, well, hell, and this week contains only one thursday.<s>'''Neutral'''.<s/> Something just doesn't seem right here, so I'm remaining neutral until/if I figure out what it is. If it was not someone like Ed Poor who nominated him, I would suspect a bad faith nomination. Since Ed Poor wouldn't do such a thing, it makes the matter even more puzzeling to me&mdash; Perhaps the oddness of this nomination is sipmly in its timing? It is worth noting that Brandon has made a step of good faith in removing the hostile tone from his user page. -'''Abstain'''. Obviously there is a great deal of contention going on here, and we may in fact be dealing with a good user who will make a solid administrator.  However, I think that this might not be the best time or the best circumstance for promotion.  I do not like the idea of hanging one's dirty laundry on one's user page, and I am fully understanding of the small sins we may commit due to frustration, but I think that a convenient gesture of good faith now is good, but not necessarily meaningful without some time to bear it out.  Perhaps this would be best revisited later.I don't oppose, I just feel I can't support at the moment.  Come back in a couple of months' time. --'''Support''' - Let me be the first to support this fine editor. --'''Support'''. Don't really understand the Oppose votes. I can't see how any of this makes him unlikely to be a good admin.'''Neutral''' Looks like a good editor to me, and I know edit counts are not that important, but user has been making edits since 2004-12-30 and only has 1404. That tells me he might not be active enough to be a admin'''Oppose''': gave the wrong answers to the RfAd questions (I didn't even realize that was ''possible''!)'''Strong Oppose'''  Somebody call a bureaucrat to close this already. Everything I think has already been said above.'''Support''' - meets [[User:Celestianpower/Adminship|my standards]]. Just because he won't be able to allocate as much time to the project doesn't mean he'll stop. He looks a responsible user and won't use his powers badly if slightly more infrequntly. No reason in my mind to oppose. Good luck! --'''Oppose''' reluctantly. I think this nominee's heart is in the right place and is a good candidate except...more than 60% of the nominee's edits were done on 10 days. 10. Ok, maybe he is contributing huge amounts in single edits. That's certainly possible. There's also the note below in his answer to question 1 where he says he available time to work on Wikipedia will go down as he starts grad school. I have real concerns about a lack of day to day, week to week involvement in Wikipedia that he would most likely have as an admin. I would like to see the nominee clarify just what his level of commitment to being an admin is, and whether he truly thinks he will have time to wield the mop. If adequate explanations are forthcoming, I would consider changing my vote. --'''Neutral''' as of now. Share concerns of [[User:Durin|Durin]]. Would definitely support if Casito demonstrated that his edits can be in a variety of topics, thereby connoting that he'll keep his eyes on a variety of topics once an admin. &ndash;'''Support''' being opinionated doesn't mean he isn't fair and can't distinguish his own POV.His previous departure came after being inappropriately blocked by his opponent in an edit war, as I recall (before 3RR enforcement was adopted), and certainly had as much to do with that as with any criticism Chamaeleon received. The reaction is understandable and shouldn't be held against him. His overall temperament is not presently well-suited for adminship, however, and his responses in this debate aren't necessarily helping his cause. --'''Emphatically oppose.''' Adminship is supposed to be no big deal.  I fear that granting it to a user like Chameleon would MAKE it VERY big deal, as it would hand him the tools to do more easily what he already does far too much of - edit warring and reverting, with his POV.  His not-too-subtle antisemitism doesn't endear him to me either.'''Oppose'''. Below 1,000 edits on articles (at the time of nomination) and hasn't edited for enough of his time here. Also didn't sign his nomination which isn't impressive.Sorry to have missed my chance to oppose him. Could someone alert me if he renominates himself any time soon? Chanting Fox, try doing more work on articles and read the article on [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|assuming good faith]]. Make it your credo and I'd change my vote.Probably will make a good admin someday, but needs more experience in general.  A wider variety of contributions will also help.'''Support'''. Chowells removes a lot of vandalism. As an admin Chowells could use rollback + ban users that keep vandalising. --''' Strong Support''' Major bonus that he created articles from stratch, I do that myself alot and it takes a ton of work and energy to learn a topic well enough to make a decent page, his time on Wikipedai isn't a problem, way past 3 months and  usually the edit count is extremely overemphasized by the voters so that doesn't matter to me as long as he has over 500. --I concur with other above. Limited Project edits and no user-talk edits will cause many to oppose.I've added '''Oppose''' here, because this seems to have been set up without the use of the normal template. I oppose creating admins who are on a POV mission, regardless of whether it's right or wrong. And I have little doubt about which category this user falls into.'''Oppose'''. I'm not sure if this RfA will get off the ground, but it's not even necessary to look outside this page for evidence of unsuitability as an admin. The personal attacks and accusations against other editors ''in the nomination'' leave me baffled.I could swing either way on this one. Let's see ... joined Wikipedia to promote [[Lyndon LaRouche]], has no understanding of [[WP:NOR]], [[WP:NPOV]], or [[WP:V]], has been blocked seven times in two months, has caused multiple pages to be protected, is abusive to other editors, engages in [[WP:POINT]], believes the Beatles worked for British intelligence, and that the Queen is a dope-pusher. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Cognition&oldid=18183135] Yikes, I can't decide. '''Oppose''' for now.'''Oppose''' based on the above... looks like this entry deserves an early removal to stop the pile-on. &nbsp;'''Opppose''' - "Most of the work that I have done on Wikipedia is actually more in the line of administrative duties such as reverting vandalism, NPOV disputes, etc. Also, I am more involved in making minor corrections such as syntax and POV fixes than in the creation of new articles and major content additions" - These things can be done as a regular user. Until you prove yourself with more articles and edits, I cannot support you.Was neutral until vote got removed instead of struck out. --Sorry. Learn how to use talkpages and I might change my mind.Support. I'm satisfied that [[User:Darwinek|Darwinek]] understands that posting copyvio stuff is a mistake and that he hasn't done that recently and won't do it again. Posting PD stuff is OK of course, although I would advise [[User:Darwinek|Darwinek]] to make liberal use of license tags and comments to make sure the origin of the material and its legal status is clear.I would support later but not now due to the copyvio issues.This should be no big deal. Benefit of the doubt.I have had no interaction positive nor negative with this user and those won't vote either way, however I do not agree with edit counting as a qualifier, though I do feel that this request should be scrutinized due to apparent hastiness of some edits and the lack of justificating summaries for edits which though not sloppy by itself causes some concern.'''Oppose'''.  Granted, I haven't seen all of this user's RfA votes, but the ones I have seen were based almost solely on longevity rather than on contributions, dedication to making WP better, or interaction with other users (except in the most obvious cases, like DrZoidberg's last week).  Also, I'm a bit leery concerning the "Wikimood" promise, as there would be little accountability for him to make sure that he only used admin powers at appropriate times. --'''Oppose'''. The removal of negative comments from your talk page is still a concern, even with the stoppage of the behavior described in the RfC. Administrators can potentially run into a lot more abuse than other editors, and describing yourself as "volatile" only leads me to believe that there will be problems in the future. Also, administrators need to be transparent in their actions. Removing legitimate complaints from your talk page, even if they are phrased in a non-friendly manner, will only muddy the waters when trying to figure out if administrative powers have been misused or abused. One shouldn't have to retrieve deleted comments from talk history in order to piece together a conversation or a dispute. I also echo Radiant's concerns about your longevity-based criterion for administrators. <font color=#00A86B>'''Neutral''' this time as per the reasons cited above, but mostly due to campaigning.Yes, I can see you've been around for a while, but I don't see a consistent level of dedication to the project during that time (there are significant gaps in time between some of your contributions). I do not consider this to be [[User:Grunt/Adminship|characteristic of a good admin]]. --'''Support''' Although I live in Florida and '''HATE''' hurricanes (especially the ones from Miami:) with a red hot passion, I support this candidate.--'''Support'''.  Seems levelheaded, and there is no harm in having a few admins who spend most of their time editing hurricane pages; procedual issues requiring an admin, like moves-over-redirects, arise everwhere, and frequently require more knowledge of things like "local" consensus on the affected pages than they do general policy knowledge. --Sorry, but '''oppose''' per lack of experience in Wikispace (<50 edits in WP, zero in WP talk). Please join some discussions at FAC, RFC, ANI or (shudder) AFD and see what it's like.'''Neutral'''. Good editor, but more variety and involvement is needed. Here are a few good links: You could help out in the  [[Wikipedia:Untagged images|Untagged Images]] section, vote frequently on [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship|RFA]]s and participate on its talk page, vote on [[Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion|AFDs]], make it a duty to watch the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&limit=500 Recent Changes] and revert vandalism, warn editors and report incessant vandals on [[Wikipedia:Vandalism in Progress]]. You could also watch and tag [[Special:Newpages]]. After familiarizing yourself with these, and continuing editing articles, you should be all set :).'''Neutral''', as the Project namespace edit count is low. I don't see a need for a mop and bucket if most of what you're doing is hurricane stuff, and though I'm heartily against editcountitis, admins have to have edits in the Project namespace. But I don't think you'd make a bad admin either, merely that adminship seems unnecessary. Your edits are very good, and you have an abundance of edits in the Talk namespace, which is a good sign. I could easily support if there was evidnece of more sysop chores going on. --'''Oppose''' - more proof of inexperience is he fact that an RfA lasts SEVEN, not TEN days. And deleting these votes is [[Wikipedia:vandalism|vandalism]]. <font color="red">Seems to be a good copyeditor, but nearly all his contributions in the Wikipedia namespace are related to this and the previous RfA.  I'm not sure that a user with relatively few total edits and little (demonstrated) interest in Wikipedia maintenance and administration needs the mop and bucket right now. His answer to Question 1 below—while showing a commendable attitude toward NPOV—doesn't shed any light on why he should have or would use admin privileges. --A "hobby user", in my opinion, by definition is not the sort of user who has a need for admin tools.  There's nothing wrong with this user, and being able to NPOV-edit religious articles is a plus (hence, my vote is neutral rather than oppose).  But I think admins by definition should be users who consider Wikipedia something more than just a hobby.From what I've seen, she has made quite a contribution to WP. She also has uncommon views and a strong personality.  All the more reason to support her.'''Support'''.  I find her different ideas refreshing.  I worry about Wikipedia going stale, only promoting those to adminship who are the sort who don't bother anyone.  I'd like to see more people who have different views of how this project could be improved to be promoted to administrator.  In Eequor's case, I'm hoping it will give her a bit more legitimacy, rather than the attitude I see here of dismissing her in thinly veiled ad hominem arguments.  I've seen some very disappointing things in this RFA from people for whom I have a lot of respect, and have seen few things about Eequor which worry me.'''Support'''. If she had switched to a new account half a year ago, I don't think there would be any objections to her adminship and people would be commending her hard work. Bygones.'''Tentatively support.''' Kim Bruning vouches for her, and I trust his judgement.I did not participate in the last RFA discussion, but have now reviewed the material.  I see a theme of aggravating behavior in the name of drawing attention to something.  (e.g. Rambot Vfd nominations, FAC nominations, rude comments about developers on meta).  Employing this sort of attention-getting strategy seems incompatible with adminship.  If she still regards such tactics as proper and fitting, there is no persuasive reason to suppose that they won't be repeated.  Without further comment on the topic, I can't tell whether she has reounced such tactics or has merely been lying low.  &mdash;I voted Support back in July; I'm glad I stopped by here so I can vote '''Support''' again. Falcon is a great user, and his work on the Dewey Decimal System is profoundly appreciated. Generally, I don't support people with less than 1200 edits; however, I believe Falcon is good enough to be an administrator. --Only ~450 edits.  Good breadth of contributions so far.  Don't see much evidence of vandalism fighting, though it could be that I can't tell from the very few edit summaries.  I like what I see, but it's just not enough.

If you continue as you are doing, I don't think I'll see any reason not to support you ''at a later date''.'''STRONG OPPOSE''', failed to do RfA self nom properly, which I had to fix (and got caught in an edit conflict with Deathphoenix, trying to fix).

As I recall, he became a little too combative in that dispute--I think that he is a little too excitable. I would be very apprehensive about his becoming an admin.'''S'''upport. Non-namespace work gave me the impression Gkhan was already an admin. While making contributions is a great way of getting admin-related experience (e.g. settling content disputes) there are other ways of acquiring these skills.'''Support''' - as Splash said, a large number of article contributions is not absolutely necessay. Gkhan now has almost 2000 total edits and has over 500 edits in the Wikipedia namespace. He is resonably mature and helps out around here, and is suitable for admin. &mdash;That Guanaco was able to accept the removal of his admin status speaks well of him. --'''Support''' There are some Wikipedians who should learn to forgive... We are humans, we all make mistakes.Support.  I'm a little shocked at the opposing comments, particularly the ones that advocate "making an example" of Guanaco.  I for one am pretty impressed that he is taking up the neccessary work to regain the trust of the community; think how much easier it would have been to create a new account from scratch with a clean slate.  However, he is taking the harder route, to clear his name in front of the people who originally de-sysopped him, and I find that pretty respectable.  This clearly shows that he has an appreciation for the Wikipedia community and policy.  I have to support that. --Three months is a pretty short time, and the edit history of the last months would hardly have motivated a candidacy. Can Guanaco do more good than bad for Wikipedia as an admin? The answers below may seem tough or cool to some and arrogant to others. In the context of the pre-history, I find the attitude far too arrogant. It worries me that a long list of the more involved Wikipedians great Guanaco back as if this attitude is what we need and wish for.I am not very familiar with Guanaco or his history, so this vote is more based on a general observation.  It seems to me that if sysopping is "not a big deal", de-sysopping is.    It hardly ever happens; so if an admin so misbehaves as to be required by the AC to go through RFA again, and 22 people oppose it after having had an opportunity to observe the person in action as an administrator, I am not sure that person should ever be an admin again, or if so, it should be after a much longer period of redemption than two or three months and a relatively small number of edits.   I wouldn't assume that a person would mature very much in three months; so I would really want to have seen a lot of good edits in stressful situations to feel that trust in him as an admin was again warranted.  If the slate was wiped clean after the de-sysop, he should at least show as much good activity as a new user who joined the site that day would be required to have in order to be supported on RFA --- as if, for example, he had simply created a new account and had been working all this time to establish a new persona.  That hasn't happened.  --<s>Neutral for now but leaning towards oppose.</s> ~500 edits, most of which are minor tweaks, since his de-sysopping is not sufficient to inspire confidence that his previous erratic behavior does not continue. Given we have enough fresh, qualified candidates for adminship, I'd prefer supporting them instead. Also seems to be running a bot on his main account (see my question below).

That's nice if it works, but the benefits to the encyclopedia are not all that great when balanced against the potential to dissipate our energies. Rehabilitating former admins strikes me as a much more useful proposition. Based on his comments here, Guanaco has acknowledged and explained his previous conduct in a way that suggests he recognizes the problems with it. I hope therefore that these scenarios will not repeat themselves. --'''Strong Oppose''' per Ambi.  Rogue admins are an increasing problem, and readminning this editor would send a very bad message.  Simply too little to gain, too much to lose.'''Never''' Guanaco used to use admin privileges to protect trolls. I'm not interested to find out if he/she has gotten over that.'''Oppose''' Changed my vote to oppose because of what I've seen.'''Oppose'''—Since his last RFA, Guanaco has done nothing to change my opinion. (In fact, it doesn't look like he's done much of anything.)  <span style="font-family:Garamond,Times,serif">'''Oppose'''. I am certainly willing to discount past issues and let bygones be bygones. However, discounting his history, I must note that there's hardly any ''recent'' history to judge him by, as he made hardly any edits from april until the end of october. So I oppose for lack of activity.'''Oppose''' per Radiant and others.  We seem to have have a nearly endless supply of good admin candidates who have no history of bad actions whatsoever... so why would we re-admin someone whose major claim-to-fame is abusing admin privledges and getting de-adminned for it?'''Oppose''': agree with Turnstep. If it weren't so hard to get something done about unaccountable admins, it would not be such a big deal, I think.I am also forced to be very neutral. On the one hand, Guanaco has done good work fighting vandalism and working on deletion. I want to assume that he would handle the role well and uncontroversially.  On the other hand, he has had significant problems in the past. The majority of the work that he wants to do(other than acutally pushing Alt+D) can be done by all users, so I think it unnecessary to give him these tools. I wouldn't be particularly worried if he were to have them, but I am by no means certain enough to support him.'''Support'''. I do admit that Halibutt's statements and actions left me consternated at times (esp. in the context of the VfD against the "Polish Black Book" or in several naming disputes). However, that was mainly against the background of a solid body of undisputedly constructive edits, which easily qualifies him for adminship. --'''Support''' To comment on some of the opposition, I was probably the very first active editor on Wikipedia to challenge some of the site’s "Russophobia," so I understand where they are coming from. I am not a Russian nationalist or a Russian myself (I happen to be of Polish Jewish descent). But at times I felt compelled to do so because a counter-balance was needed in order to ensure WP:NPOV, and no one else was providing it. Otherwise, "Russophobia" is always going to be pervasive in an English-speaking online community because of the legacy of the Cold War. Therefore, at times I have been in strong disagreement with Halibutt. But I was able to reach a understanding with him during our first encounter, and all of my run-ins with him since then were quite cordial. Halibutt may have a strong point of view shaped by personal and family experiences with the oppressive end of Soviet and Russian imperialism, but so what? ''Everyone'' has a point of view.  Unlike the POV editors unsuited for adminship, however, Halibutt is able to work constructively with editors whose worldviews starkly diverge from his own, and he is able to compromise. There are really no compelling reasons to oppose his nomination at this time.'''Support''' Strong views, but willing to discuss, productive, reliable, concerned with the project.'''Support'''. Halibutt is dedicated wikipedian, who contributed a lot of articles and is always able to reach and respect the consensus'''Support''' Has done a lot of good work on difficult topics. --'''Oppose.'''  Eugene van der Pijll refers to Halibutt's "widening" the Gdansk dispute, but I'm not sure he really indicates [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=Halibutt&offset=20050607&limit=300|the scale of it].  About 200 edits purporting to apply the results of the Gdansk vote (admittedly highly problematic in itself, but that's another day's work) to some pretty unrelated-looking articles, including at least one 3rr violation in the process, and ignoring repeated attempts to desist.  This seems as clear an example of [[WP:POINT]] as one could wish to see (or rather, be dismayed at), and one I wouldn't care to see replicated with the use of the extra buttons.I really don't know about this user - but judging by his edits he seems like an amazing individual! You might want to count this as more a neutral that is siding with support, but as I haven't encountered him before I really can't in good faith vote support or object. The fact that Piotrus nominated him speaks well for him, though. Also, Grutness seems to think he's OK, and he's a pretty good judge of character. However, Radiant is also a good judge of character, and he voted oppose. So '''neutral''' for me. -I'd support his request if it weren't for his bizarre Dresden/Aachen/Mainz edit war last June.'''Neutral''' I am changing my vote from '''Oppose''' to '''Neutral''' since the Black book  is deleted and it appeared that he was not the main author of this item. I have read a few hundreds of the recent Hailbutt edits and they all appeared to be in quite a good faith and many show deep knowledge on a wide range of subjects (especially of European History) that would never hurt any administrator to have. He is not unlike in this regard to his major opponent [[User:Ghirlandajo]].  On the other hand I still have some rezervations about the Book history (IMHO an ideal administrator should try to eliminate such things, not to support them, especially if they come from the people of his own POV) and the history of the template - having the interests of his petty edit war over the usability of the Wiki. So my present vote is '''Neutral'''.'''Neutral'''. There's a lot of decent contribution from the user, but there's also a decent amount of controversy -- when people are made an admin, it should be because it's obvious to almost everyone that it should be. That's not yet the case here -- recommend coming back in a few months without having any controversy generated in the meantime and without Piotr babysitting every aspect of the nomination. If that happens, I will probably support. --'''Support'''. Your work and interactions with other Wikipedians look good. I have one suggestion, however: please remember to always use [[Wikipedia:Edit summary|edit summaries]].'''Oppose'''. Nothing personal, I just don't think you've been here long enough. Also, the comments by Meelar are worrying. -'''Neutral'''. I agree with Lupo. I like what I'm seeing, but I'm hesitant to vote for you just yet. Get another thousand or so edits under your belt and maybe another month and then you're golden. Also, do you have a [[Wikipedia:Featured articles|featured article]]? I suggest you get one; even new editors that have had a major part to do with getting an article up to featured status tend to get much more attention. If you do all of this, I will not hesitate to vote support for you. [[User:Linuxbeak|Linuxbeak]] |<s>'''Neutral'''. While Harro is committed and does good RC patrol, he is too lenient in dealing with articles. For example, Harro uses the verify and userfy tags too much, even when vanity is obvious (although I guess the article will be deleted soon, here is a diff: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Murdoch_Wilkinson&diff=prev&oldid=17820133]). This leniency concerns me, although i'm willing to be convinced to support here. [[User:Hedley|Hedley]] 1 July 2005 19:59 (UTC)</s> '''Support''' now, although if the adminship passes i'd like Harro5 to be more bold in speedying vanity.'''Support'''- though I voted neutral last time, the only reason was because the "joke" (i.e. vandalism) was too recent. Now that time has passed, I beleive Harro5 would make a good admin. [[User:Flcelloguy|Flcelloguy]] |<small> [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A <font color = brown> note? ]]</font color>|'''<s>Weak</s> support'''. Good use of edit summaries, good edits.  My concern lies mostly with the fact that some editors would never do joke vandalism, and also some of your actions show activity based on a lack of knowledge. (For instance, [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Jehovah's Witness Co-operative Alliance|here]], you voted to delete based on a false premise (you seemed to think this was a JW organization, when a cursory glance at the talk page showed it was an anti-JW organization). That's just one example where I remembered running into you.  Mostly good job; just be sure to use your judgement- and it has improved substantially since last time. --Seems to me that most of the oppose-voters on his previous RFA do so because of Harro's lack of experience. In my opinion, that means he should not renominate himself so soon, thus '''oppose'''.'''Support'''. I know this editor personally and I am certain that he will be a dedicated and reliable admin. I also think the history of his actions on Wikipedia recommend him highly.'''Extreme Loki > Thor Support'''. User checks out good and I like what I see.'''Support'''. I firmly believe in (and have personally witnessed!) this user's devotion to Wikipedia, its quality and neutrality.'''Suppport''' It's his coolness under fire that impresses me. He argues his views reasnably enough, though I don't entirely agree with him.'''Oppose'''. I have to agree with MPerel here. I am also concerned that it appears this editor has begun to list this RFA in other places to gather support.'''Oppose'''. Before anyone dismisses this as simply being vindictive, please read to the end, my opposition is based on more than the vandalism incident.  As has already been discussed, Hedley and I (and others) were involved in a game on the CoolClarity message boards - both of us made two or three vandalisms, nothing more.  About a month later I found that I had been blocked, after Hedley decided that he needed to drop someone else in it to save his own skin.  This is the text of a private message that I received from him on the CoolClarity message board on 20th March: ''"If you want to know the whole truth, in this PM, I was just trying to impress the big guns in the Wikipedia room by coming clean by adding Zakir Raman to VfD. When I supplied them the info on the link to here, they noticed you and I guess I spoke to some strict admins about it because they put you up on the RfC. I don't intentionally mean to grass anyone up, but I wasn't gonna say that on Wikipedia.. Thing is, I didn't want to get a block, so I was defending myself. No intention to be hostile toward you or anything, but I was stuck in a situation where it was defend you and get blocked, or go on the side of the admins and come away fairly clean.."'' I don't think someone who is willing to twist the truth like that to further his own Wikipedia career is suitable to be an admin. My other objections revolve around the two occasions that I have encountered Hedley while making edits on here.  The first involves the page [[Nelson Piquet, Jr.]], which I created in October.  In March I was informed on [[User_talk:David_5000|my talk page]] by Hedley that ''"Hey, your article Nelson Piquet, Jr. was a duplicate of an existing article on him, so i've changed it to a redirect. You'll find there was an article of more depth already at Nelson Angelo Piquet."''  Of course if you compare the history of both pages [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelson_Piquet%2C_Jr.&action=history 1] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelson_Angelo_Piquet&action=history 2] you'll see that Hedley was wrong: my page was there five months earlier - when I questioned him about this on his talk page I didn't receive a response.  The second issue is about the page for the racing driver [[Mathias Lauda]].  Hedley created the page with the incorrect title 'Matthias Lauda', but when I renamed the page he quickly reverted it to the incorrect version without checking whether he was correct.  Again my questions went unanswered.  These experiences make me think that <u>Hedley is inclined to make comments and edits without checking his facts first</u> - I'm concerned that Wikipedia would give moderator powers to someone who acts without checking whether his actions are justified first.'''Oppose''':  On FAC, she has been a helpful voter some of the time, but when her own issues and articles are at stake, she seems to have an inappropriate temperament.  This is a specific issue, as the ability to keep one's poise when one's favorite issues and articles are edited/deleted/rewritten is important when one has the revert, delete, and move powers.Being an admin is a different kind of task from being a good editor.  Needs to get to know the community better.  HW - keep up the good work.'''Oppose''' Even though I'm normally against judging people on number of edits I have to agree that we don't know enough about his work so I'd say it might be better if he waited awhile to either self nominate again or be nominated by somebody else. <small>Vote made byNot right now. What I have seen so far is good but not enough edits, and not enough contribution to the article space in the form of new writing. Keep at it, and I can see myself supporting in a few months.Borderline '''Support'''.  I was close to voting neutral on this one.  However, the friendliness shown to newcomers is a very good quality in an admin.  I believe that you will use the admin powers wisely.  --I supported his previous RFA out of encouragement for his sheer enthousiasm, which I believe is a very important quality. However, I do think that two self-noms in so short a span of time make him a bit overeager. I believe Howabout should keep up his good work and wait for someone else to nominate him (as will undoubtedly happen) and I will certainly support then.I am very surprised that the nominated user accepted two days after he had withdrew his self-nom. This is an abuse of process. I am sorry, but his accepting this nomination tells me he will not make a good admin. It is doubtful I will ever vote for him now. He has my sincerest apologies.'''Oppose'''. The behaviour of this user proves that he does not believe in consensus; in fact, he'll either ignore it or try to get around it. I find it difficult to believe that someone who games the system by using carefully-spaced reverts to avoid 3RR, or sneaks in controversial changes by marking them as minor, would actually abide by his word and never use his admin powers on the one topic in which ''almost all'' his edits are. This is a one-track editor with a clear POV and mission, as proven 16,000 times over. I will reconsider my vote if ArbCom clears him of any wrongdoing.I believe that this user has not been editing for long enough as a non-vandal. My standards state 3+ months, and though I am willing to support those who do not meet them if they have other redeeming qualities, I don't see enough in this user to do so. Additionally, past history of vandalism gives me some pause. '''Oppose'''.'''Oppose'''. Too inexperienced in my opinion. --May the Force be with you!As per Radiant. I trust him to use his powers only for consensus, never for evil.'''Support''' The votes opposing Kappa for adminship have spoken even more eloquently of his good qualities than those in favor. To call him an extreme inclusionist is simply incorrect.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FAlisonfire&diff=14740578&oldid=14733019] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Saga&diff=14732009&oldid=14731901]  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Www.chowk.com&diff=prev&oldid=14439289].--'''Absolutely not''': The reasons for wishing admin status ring false, and Kappa routinely ignores existing deletion policy on VfD.  One should not become an admin simply to try to pull articles out of deletion.  You can already remove speedy tags, already ''add content to articles'' to keep them from being speedies, and already go to VfU and argue for restoration of improper deletions.  Reaching into the deletion log and undeleting articles is not valid by anyone.  VfU is required for every single one.I'm not ready to vote in support. On examining recent VfD's, some of Kappa's comments are annoying responses that really amount to nothing more than "Keep, because I think this article should be kept." Others, however, are well-articulated and move the discussion forward. He is not a robot-like inclusionist by any means. In response to my comment below he gave examples of some good short articles he contributed, and he has over 3000 edits in the main namespace, but on looking at them it seems to me that he mostly does minor touchups. However, becoming an admin is not supposed to be a big deal and I don't see any particular reason to oppose, either.'''Oppose, with caveat:''' While I agree that Kappa is worthy - and I certainly have no objections to an inclusionist - I'm concerned that it looks like he's being forced into this vote when he's reluctant. I don't think people should be forced to be admins if they don't want to be, so unless there's indication that he's happy to be an admin, I'm opposing.<s>Absolutely. [[User:El C|El_C]] 22:06, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</s> &mdash; <s>I'm a concrned with his responses, and I note some of the comments bellow.

I'm a little worried about his English, and more worried by his rather snappish responses to criticism. Reading through his replies, I'm unable to work out what he means sometimes (e.g., "I am not [[user:oceanographer]] - I made them"), and if he can't keep his temper here, when one would have expected him to be on his best behaviour, then there are definite concerns more widely.'''Oppose''' as per [[User:DropDeadGorgias|DropDeadGorgias]], vandals shouldn't be editors, not to mention admins--'''Support''' Just edit the freakin' article I say :).

I followed some of the links and it should be noted '''personal attacks occurred on the user's own user page'''. Now, this doesn't fundamentally absolve the person of attacks but I do believe in leeway on your own page. Has he launched attacks on other talk pages? I'm neutral for this reason. I don't particularly like JETFP or whatever it is, but it isn't a vote-changer.'''Neutral''' I think that Lord Voldemort has reformed (although this [[Voldemort|doesn't make sense]]) of the personal attacks. Evidence pointing to this are things like his apology, and involvement with projects such as [[WP:ESP|Esperanza]]. However, I am not positive, and JEFTA really doesn't seem necessary, since editing the articles is the whole point of Wikipedia. Give one more month on Wikipedia with some good, strong editing, and I will support.Neutral solely for time.  Personal attacks on user pages are nasty, but they're not exactly a sign of how a person is going to interact with others.  As for JETFA, am I the only one who gets it?  There is an implicit criticism of those people who chalk up 1,000 edits by ''not editing,'' but rather in ''tagging.''  The idea is, "the same energy you used to tag it could have fixed it."  It's a "sofixit" that reminds us that tagging it ain't fixing it.  That, to me, is a gentle chiding and a very encouraging thing.  To me, that looks like someone trying to make us less tagged and more fixed, which is a cause of celebration.  Still, the time is too short at this point, and the interactions are still too few.'''Support''', after careful consideration. I give him the benefit of the doubt. If anything goes wrong we can always de-sysop. --<s>The who is or isn't who should get resolved first, before RFA . I noted that lot of edits lack summaries.I've already told him that 500 would be too little for RFA before he submitted, so I have to oppose.I agree with the other neutral votes. There's nothing that makes me think he'd be a bad admin, but there's also very little to make me trust him. In addition, it makes it really difficult to judge a candidate when they interact more on IRC or the mailing list than on Wikipedia itself. There's nothing wrong with interaction outside WP, but I think adminship should be based solely on contributions that ''everyone'' can view. Finally, I strongly encourage Luigi to use edit summaries on a more consistent basis.'''Support''' No one has offered any evidence of bad behaviour. This editor seems willing to learn from his previous errors, and seems eager and willing to contribute as an admin. Seems distinctly non-crazy. Give him the mop!'''Oppose'''. Sorry, but too soon. What work I've seen is good, but, as Deathphœnix and others have said admin now would be too hasty. If you keep going as you are I've no doubt you will become an admin, just not now.Useful effective editor but lacks experience and shows no commitment to admin tasks. --Reluctantly oppose.  Seems like he means well but 300 edits is a bit too few.  Please, come back a little later.Being an admin is more than just working on the main page.'''Oppose'''. You're a bit green still, but you look like you've got good intentions. Pretty much everything that needs to be said has already been said. [[User:Linuxbeak|Linuxbeak]] | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] |'''Strong Oppose''' His response to Celestianpower showed to me that he's unable to deal with disputes in a constructive way, his edit count is low, the response to answer #1 shows a complete misunderstanding of admin duties(regarding asking for consensus before doing ''anything'', which almost sounds like someone would need to babysit him), and the final nail in the coffin was the self nom per my views on them at [[User:Karmafist/wikiphilosophies]].'''Oppose'''. Sorry about piling on, but I have to agree with Celestianpower and Drini. Needs more experience first, and we'll see what happens.'''Oppose'''.

Please take your time to answer the candidacy questions first. It is an important criteria before anyone considers any support for you. -'''Oppose'''. While I generally hold admins to a high standard, I hold self-nominating ones to an even  higher one. Your short answers to the questions are therefore not good. In particular, some examples for question #3 would have been nice, plus a little more than "etc" for question number one.'''Strong Oppose''' &ndash; The user has not specified an email ID as of this post.

Both sides seem to be POV-warrioring and both sides have come close to (but not, as far as I can tell, violated) 3RR, and Paul has been characterizing as "vandalism" edits he merely disagrees with.  I am concerned that Paul would misuse administrative authority to win these edit wars.  I am also bothered by the fact that he will make the second revert without first attempting to communicate with the other editor via either article or user talk pages; clearly his communication skills are not up to administrative standards.Good contributor with what looks like a solid record and wants adminship for constructive reasons.'''Support''' Edits well-placed across namespaces. Friendly and thoughtful whenever I've noticed a comment.I like you as a user, but there is a big reason why I feel I can't.

You're suggestion for a new username (when you decided to change it (the discussion can be found at [[Wikipedia:Changing username/Archive3]] near the bottom) was The Wandering Bastard, something which I also find wildly inappropriate. I'm sorry, but that is enough for me to oppose your rfa.'''Weak oppose''' for the moment. It is PB's bad luck that the first of his edits I have noticed was adding &#123;{db|movie review}} to [[Invisible Child]]. Since when was ''movie review'' a criterion for speedy? --'''Oppose'''. I don't think you have been around long enough. Your constant edit counting bothers me (sample comment: "1950 edits, ha ha!"), as does the self-nomination. The first article I clicked on that you edited was [[Rita Wilson]], which, while small, was wrong. The [[Carl Radle]] article is nice, but there seems to be little else of substance except for lots of user page editing. You also state below (question 3) that you have "high standards for Admins" but self-nominate yourself after exactly 3 months?'''Oppose'''. I applaud the enthusiasm, but - as it says at the top of this page - three months and 1000 edits is the usual bare minimum. Also, editing articles is fine, but admins do far more than that, so it's worth getting involved in and finding out about some of the other facets of wikipedia before trying for admin status. If your enthusiasm is anything to go by, I'm sure you'll eventually get to admin status - but now is far too soon.'''Support''' - more and more I'm seeing people on RfA who I've interacted with/seen about the place doing good work and 2 months is definately, in my opinion, long enough in the past. --[[user:Celestianpower|Cel]]<font color=green>[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]</font>'''Support''', that vandalism was more than three months ago.

SamuraiClinton either does not understand the concept of consensus or chooses to ignore it when it doesn't suit his needs, as evidenced at the VfD discussion for [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Autosexuality|Autosexuality]] (in particular, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FAutosexuality&diff=12254081&oldid=12253938] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FAutosexuality&diff=12261269&oldid=12254081]).'''Oppose'''. I can't support someone who doesn't meet his own admin criteria.'''Oppose'''. From user page, [[User:Scott Gall|Scott Gall]] writes: "[[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|Point of view]] should be allowed in moderation in articles where some parts are unknown. [[Wikipedia:Edit war|Edit wars]] should also be justified in this case." Clearly does not understand the fundamental principle of Wikipedia.'''Oppose''' for now. I would like to see him interact more on the talk pages.  It is important to be able to see how he interacts with others in discussions.  This probably explains his answer to number three below.  Conflict with others is not a bad thing, it is how you resolve the conflict which is what I want to see, a key attribute of an admin. --'''Support''' Does some good work and is dedicated. Good admin material.I'll second the comments of the perceptive Haukur, and add that -- if your friends really know so little about the world (per your userpage) -- you should get more friends, especially among WPians, who are stuffed with knowledge! :)'''Support'''.  Sounds like this editor will put the tools to good use. With nearly 2000 edits and a year on Wikipedia, I think Simetrical has shown that he is unlikely to misuse the tools. --'''Oppose''' - per Zoe. Based on his AfD votes, I do not feel Simetrical has a sufficient grasp of article deletion and inclusion policies, and do not at this point feel comfortable with his ability to make impartial judgements on consensus if given the power to close AfD discussions. I don't expect administrators to agree with all current policies, but I do expect them to respect the policies, and I'm not sure if the candidate in question does.Crypto's links leave me wondering if you'd be able to effectively handle a dispute calmly when you have admin tools at your disposal.'''Support'''.  I see him during RC patrol and he does good work.  My concerns below have been addressed by him, so I think he could do a good job w/ the mop. -'''Oppose''' per Splash and Tony Sidaway. I've found other incidents of incivility as well. --'''Oppose''' I am not well acquainted with the gentleman in question, but the comments brought up by Splash and Tony, as well as a check of his edit history, do cast his temperement in a rather poor light. Anyone who is not capable of garnering the respect of his peers should not be an admin, in my opinion.--IMHO, this user does not yet have enough experience in the community.Good editor, but does not have the commitment to either this project or to adminship that I expect from a proposed admin.Reluctantly '''oppose'''. Squeakbox has been involved in a couple nasty conflicts with POV pushing users. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but his approach to these conflicts has caused them to escalate. For example he posted notes on Cumbey's blog, escalating his dispute with that user. Squeakbox sometimes brings animosity upon himself, such as a couple weeks ago when he said to another user, "Fuck off Nazi scum" [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zapatancas&diff=18900583&oldid=18820093]. Granted, he removed his personal attack within minutes but the user found it in the page's history and continues to harass SqueakBox about it. You've done great work on articles but I think you need a thicker skin to be an administrator.'''Careful support''' - user is a good editor but needs to relax as far as how SPUI points out.  I don't like cuss words either, but it's impossible to remove them from an all-inclusive project.  --'''Oppose''', removes [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASPUI&diff=18621025&oldid=18609597 "offensive content" consisting of text from user pages] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fonzie_Fann&diff=prev&oldid=18621400 the word "fuck" from messages when not used as a personal attack]. --Agree with RadicalBender. Also needs to learn to use the preview button more often.Not yet. Glad to have you on Wikipedia, but I don't think you're ready to be an administrator. I think the questions should have been answered already, for a self-nomination. Also, use of the {{tl|vprotected}} tag on your user page is not appropriate; this should not be placed on unprotected pages. You have a very high edit count, but it seems it takes many edits to accomplish one thing, such as the seven edits to [[WP:RFA]] to place this nomination. Increased use of the "preview" function would be helpful, I feel. Try to become a little more familiar with Wikipedia policy if you would like to become an administrator. Other than that, keep up your good work. &mdash;And thar blows my vote record too, I bet. Oh, no!

My name is: Uncle G"  --'''Support'''. The lack of a user page is quirky, and probably an error in judgement, but I don't see any other evidence that Uncle G would be anything other than a good and helpful administrator. I actually admire the fact that Uncle G has ''not'' created one, given the obvious fact that he could create one, assuage the discomfort of those opposing him solely because of this, be made an administrator, and then delete his user page. Good sense of both independence and honor there. --I read Uncle G's lengthy explanation below and it, by itself, is enough for me to vote no.  I can appreciate the fight against the stigma of a blank user page, but the fact of the matter is that it does make things easier for other people.'''Oppose'''.  It's fine for editors to contribute without a user page, but it's not fine for admins.  It rather seems like a policeman or any other official insisting on performing the job without wearing a uniform to identify himself properly. Uncle G needs '''neither''' user page '''nor''' adminship to continue his great work. --Someone below cited angry outbursts, but outbursts don't bother me much. What's really important for an admin is to generally have the right course.Agree with Theo.  I would hate to think that a couple of nasty remarks would forever prevent an editor from becoming an admin.  On the other hand, the activity cited by CryptoDerk is quite extreme, and not exactly ancient history, either (just over a month ago).  Apologies do count for a lot, but I cannot vote to support at this time.  Perhaps Vikreykja's best course of action is to wait until it ''is'' ancient history, and then try again.[[User:Doc glasgow|Doc]] [[User talk:Doc glasgow|(?)]] 22:36, 1 November 2005 (UTC) seems good enough - and has promised to use edit summaries in future --'''Oppose''' per Durin note on image-tagging.

He's very good at fighting vandalism.'''Strong Oppose'''.  Far too new, far too abrasive.   Virtually no positive article space contributions, seems only interested in deleting and reverting.  Anyone doing RC patrol is appreciated, but any Admins doing RC patrol need to be much more diplomatic, even when dealing with vandals.  Treat people like dogs, they act like dogs.  It's a self-amplifying circuit I'd rather see in the hands of someone who wants to lower the hostility levels rather than raise them.  Would also like to see much better use of edit summaries. --'''Oppose''' on several grounds: Abrasive style, frequently uninformative edit summaries, and deletion of useful links. All these build a picture of questionable judgement.  I have no doubt that Weyes is an asset to the project and is well-intentioned.  I would expect to support a nomination after a few months of courteous interaction, consistent edit summaries, and more cautious link removal. Consider [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lexmark&diff=next&oldid=15471073 this edit] in which Weyes removes a link to Lexmark's company profile at ''Computer Business Review'' with the summary "rv spam". It is one of dozens of similar deletions made yesterday. I understand that CBR sells more detailed reports than those it publishes on its web-site (and is, therefore, a commercial site) but this is no different to linking to ''Stuff'', the ''Daily Telegraph'', or one of the many other publishing sites that sell subscriptions. Inappropriate deletions like this have been flagged to Weyes repeatedly. To be persisting with them after such warnings and while such behaviour is being discussed at RFA is not the behaviour that I seek of an admin.&mdash;'''Support''', as before: Notwithstanding valid issues brought up at the previous vote, I have enough trust in Weyes for him to be given admin privileges.'''Oppose'''.  It's funny, because everybody says that adminship is "no big deal", but everyone acts like it is, particularly here.  The simple fact of the matter is that blocking users is a big power, and not everyone should have it, perhaps even (dare I say it) some of our current admins.  [[User:TheoClarke|Theo]] makes some good points, and I was surprised that on the original debate, sockpuppets weren't just discounted and the votes tallied, which would have resulted in Weyes application being rejected. I don't doubt that they ('''edit:'''the bureaucrats) acted in good faith, but it casts an un-needed cloud over Weyes application nomination. I would suggest letting it cool down, and coming back in a month or so.  After all, if it's no big deal anyway, what does it matter if there's a bit of a wait? --'''Strong support'''.

No way should an editor who had to be put under revert parole be given the capability to roll back edits, no matter what he promises.

It has been suggested that 'Zappaz' is a new identity of an existing editor created especially for his pro-Rawat work. It has also been suggested that Zappaz has been paid by the Rawat cult for this work. I would just like to add that if these allegations are true, then Zappaz has earned every penny as his dedication to portraying this cult leader in a positive manner is a credit to his professionalism. --'''Neutral''' based upon the comments of everyone in this RFA.Edit summaries are commonly used by vandals to try to disguise malicious edits, so they're not foolproof.  --'''Oppose'''.

Over 150 of those edits are on his own user page - [[User:CyborgTosser]].  Also those edits often break down to many edits on one page (looking recently 14 for [[Symbolic combinatorics]], 8 for [[Semi-empirical mass formula]]).  This user has mostly editted pages on music he likes, science fiction and electrical engineering.  He has not been involved at all in pages like this one (requests for adminship), votes for deletion or any other page which shows him having much interaction with other Wikipedia users.  This is something Johnleemk brought up during his previous self-nomination, and I concur with him.  We have no idea how he would act as an admin, since his interaction has been limited, and admin privileges are all about how he deal with interaction.  He edits pages in his fields of interest, occasionally posts on a discussion page, and once in a blue moon has a discussion on a discussion page.  Due to his limited number of edits, which are on his user page or the same pages multiple times in a small number of fields, and his lack of interaction with other users which is what admin power is all about, I oppose this nomination.<s>Support -- a good contributor.</s>  172, I don't know what you're talking about -- many admins were promoted with less than 1,000 edits (I think a significant minority or a majority of promotions from 7/2003 - 1/2004 were in that category), and I was promoted with less than 500 edits.Support enthusiastically.

One of the best contributors to come through Wikipedia in a while.I also support Mike's evil twin brother Hank, who (when he regains his lost memory and returns from Darkest Peru, intending to frame Mike for his own murder) would also make an excellent (if evil) admin. &mdash;I suppose at this point, my vote is a mere formality...Although Tim has been here for a long time, I don't feel he has participated enough with the community to be ready for adminship. i would support him at a future date, however, after i feel he has enough experience working with and in this community.Adds good content, interested in administration (as demonstrated by his thoughtful discussion on how best to implement the AOTW idea,) and generally good guy.Nothing personal here. I simply don't think Tom- has enough experience in the community yet. I will definitely support in a few months, if his track record continues.Support. Low activity levels are not a reason to withold administrator status. -Has been a complete pleasure to work with. Name suggests Estonian background?Great contribs to (at least) cryptography articles; has always been exemplarily polite and reasonable when I've had disagreements over articles with him.Support.  If people engage in edit wars with him, he can now protect the page and make the needed changes.Support, though I think he will need to be careful not to use admin powers in articles he is involved with.Fully Support we need people who know middle eastern history!Oppose. Involved (rightly or wrongly) in lots of edit wars and such. We need admins who are upstanding non-controversial wikipedians, regardless of what swell guy people think he is.Second John Collison's thought above.  The Zonester will serve Wikipedia well!  He also shows curiosity about topics outside his native Ireland - he's dialogued with me about California transportation topics in [[Ridge Route]], and added to that article by his questions.  --If Anthony does not desire to be an admin for any purpose other than to view deleted articles, and he is able to use Kate's tool, mentioned below, to do so, then I see no reason to give him admin status. --Strongly oppose. Anthony has shown a pattern of agreeing to cease trollish behavior, then starting right back up again after a little time has passed. I don't doubt that he would pull the same sorts of shenanigans if he was given admin privileges and "promised" not to use them for anything other than viewing deleted articles. [[User:Gwalla|<nowiki></nowiki>]] &mdash;So far no comment or acceptance from Anthony DiPierro, or did i just miss it? In any case, the tool mentioned below should be enough for his needs --His statement in support of Zero0000's nomination, quoted already by Anthony above, shows a serious misunderstanding of our protection policy. --Last time I said "he has done good work, and is more active than most in discussing matters in article talk pages. Good admin material, imho," and that seems even more true now. &mdash;Oppose, for the reasons listed above. I've seen nothing that suggests that this person is cut out to be an administrator. The mostly non-substantive comments in support of this nomination have done nothing to persuade me to vote in favour. I have to wonder what qualifies a person for a position of authority who has not even interacted with the community in any significant way. The standard should be higher than that.I am <u>quite</u> sorry.  I rarely vote for ''oppose'', but there are too many detractor's on EDGE's record.  First is his ''snits with other users'' and when andy said that EDGE has ''introduced himself with acts of vandalism''.  Second, and I say this to EDGE himself, you do not need to be an administrator to write articles on ''azmatology, poetic terrorism, and pirate utopias''.  Third, EDGE has underestimated what kind of experience is asked of him as an administrator.  Fourth, he has a very fresh view of how the community works.  I doubt that he read the rules on nominating himself in much depth, or he wouldn't have voted for himself, much less neutrally so.  I would like to say to EDGE that you may want to consider a re-self-nomination after ''at least'' 1000 edits.  Good luck!  --User created a lot of nonsense articles on "poetic terrorism" a few days ago, moved user and talk pages to random locations, and caused general mayhem.Too new, and too much odd stuff. A month or two of good, solid wikipeding may change my mind.Way, way, way too new; come back here in a couple of months and I'll be happy to support. --This just about says it all about Eequor - ''"Clearly strict adherence to the "rules" is a naïve and insular position"'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Eequor&diff=6174589&oldid=6174566]Cannot support unilateral actions and do not believe admins should have "leeway": that's a licence for roguery.Tricky, given that the account was created in May. Doesn't even have 50 edits and most of those are troublesome. --All of Lir's nominations on this page are jokes.  As is Lir himself.Support. I see absolutely no reason for punishing an editor for not involving himself in policymaking or the swirling, stinking BS that passes for it, nor for avoiding the petty politics and borderline warfare that some Wikipedia namespace articles host. It would probably be much more beneficial for Wikipedia if we ''discouraged'' it, given that we already have more than enough policy to go round when [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|this]] would actually suffice.'''Strongly''' oppose. Two reasons. 1. I plan to use my admin status to block users is not promising. I wouldn't vote for anyone who saw this as the primary goal of adminship. 2. I firmly believe consensus is built on talk, not reversion and forcing your POV. I am not so much worried by his blanking the talk page as his general attitude that he will decide for himself when people need "censoring". Contrition and a repeated commitment to consensus would have been far more persuasive than being adamant that censorship is a valuable tool for an editor. I've changed my vote to reflect the further discussion with LGagnon.He expressed interest to me in being nominated last week, but I was so busy that I didn't respond to his email or recommend him. I would have, however. I support.Seconding all that has been said previously. I'd have nominated him myself, but Rick beat me to it.I usually don't oppose nominations, but I am seriously concerned abouth Lucky's lack of regard for both [[Wikipedia:Etiquette|Wikiquette]] and [[Wikipedia:WikiLove|Wikilove]]. These are qualities that are essential to be a leader/[[sysop]] in a tolerant community. Perhaps, if he changes his behavior I can support in the future. -Seems to have done a lot of good work - but sometimes appears to lack objectivity, and has shown occasional poor tolerance for opposing viewpoints. I'd like to see greater consistency before supporting.--Yes, a thousand times yes. (feel free to count that as 1001 distinct votes.) [[User:Rhymeless|Support, appears to be a very dedicated member of the community -I would love to be able to vote for Lucky.  He is an excellent contributor, a tireless workhorse of Wikipedia, doing many thankless tasks.  If this was a vote concerning whether or not Lucky deserved thanks and honor for this work, I'd support hands down.  Sadly, though, Lucky's temper, especially with newbies, is seemingly incompatible with the role and responsibilities of an admin.  I am very open to the possibility that Lucky will find better ways of communicating displeasure, and gentler methods of working with new users -- I opposed Mike H, way back when, out of a concern for the way he handled disputes, and I'm now pleased to say I think he's very good at it and I was happy to support him when he was renominated.  I fervently hope that Lucky takes a similar path.  Until Lucky consistently respects [[Wikipedia:Wikiquette]] and [[Wikipedia:Wikilove]], though, I'm afraid I will continue to oppose, and simply thank him sincerely for the many hours of work he does here.Seems as if Lucky likes to put speedy tags on articles which may be notable or those which are precedented as VfD material.  His over-zealousness alone makes me cautious, but coupled with very recent insults on talk pages - ''"Yo, fucktard. Take your cute, little, fluffy doggie and stick him where the sun don't shine. Get a life, buttbleed."'' - just drives the nail in the coffin.I'm about of an age with ''Marine'' (call me Army 67-69) and I'd be flattered if one of my daughters nominated me so nicely, but this is way too soon in terms of time, edits and variety. Hope he'll be back in a couple of months when we know him better. --'''Oppose'''. Far too soon for adminship. Moreover, those things which she has done would not be enhanced by adminship.What Lst27 said. Maurreen's a good editor, but could brush up on her etiquette a little.Too few edits. If he has 300 now, how many did he have when he first nominated himself? --Haven't run into Nathanlarson32757, but the most unpleasant thing I can find in his history is [[pet skunk|some skunks]], so he has my full support.   --I apologize, but you haven't been a user long enough for me to support. Get more experience first. --[[User:Ta bu shi da yu|Ta bu shi da yu]] 13:03, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC) way too early, though I really like his [[pet skunk]] article :-)Antisocial to the extreme. Regularly does controversial things unilaterally. Would very likely end up a rogue admin.Absolutely not. A history of fairly extreme <s>uncivil, </s><u>(I don't have any of my own specific examples to cite, don't want to spend any more time trying to find what caused my general belief that this was a concern, and tend to agree that 'piggy backing' on other's comments is unfair. Also, I will add that I have seen many people say things on #wikipedia that they would never say in a more permanent forum--if people think VfD gets rough sometimes, it's still like a Quaker picnic compared to what can go on at #wikipedia, and I don't even want to try to imagine what probably goes on during private chats.)</u>unilateral behavior, and ignoring of consensus, even if brief, <u>IMHO </u>needs to be followed by a '''LONG''' history of <s>civil, </s>community-minded behavior, which is more like at least six months, not two. BTW, where are the 'questions of the candidate'?Here for under 2 months.  Has far less editing experience than sheer number might suggest; most edits have been minor, and to a small number of articles (for instance this cumulative diff for  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Dennis_Kucinich&diff=3709165&oldid=3688918 '''101''' consecutive edits] to [[Dennis Kucinich]], only 43 of which were marked as minor).  Not always careful about '''wikiquette'''; see for instance this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk%3ACharles_Graner&diff=0&oldid=4483767 blanking] of [[Talk:Charles Graner]] (an article Neutrality had self-nom'ed on fac), uncharacteristically marked as minor.[[User:Rex071404|Rex071404]] 23:42, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC) There is currently an Arbitration case pending, in which [[User:Neutrality|Neutrality]] is named as both a complainant and a respondant [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rex071404]. As strongly as I can possibly say, I feel that Neutrality is not qualified for Admin. Should he attain that role now, it would I feel, bring discredit on and loss of respect for, the title of Admin. Please be advised that at the begining of that Arb case, Neutrality took the extremely inappropriate step of actually deleting my facts from the case page! He was strongly reprimanded by Fred Bauder for that. Also, Neutrality has an Rfc [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Neutrality] pending against him for the misleading nature of his user name. Also, Neutrality recently reverted me 9 times on one article in one day [[John Kerry]] and when I opposed him on that article over time, I was the one who got banned from editing it! Neutrality also has his fingerprints all over the squabbling at [[George_W._Bush]]. Neutrality recently used vulgar language against me and just now today, taunted me on my talk page (an entry which I deleted). He constantly reverts people with false and misleading edit summaries. He refuses to dialog. And he quite obviously holds grudges.He's made some good contributions, and I hope he continues to work as an editor.  Unfortunately, I think his strong feelings on the topic of Kosovo may hurt his ability to use his admin priveleges wisely.Good work, my friend, but you do not quite meet my [[User:Blankfaze/admin|personal standards]] for supporting an adminship candidate.Has not been here very long, so I could not support unless this was a truly exceptional candidate in terms of edit quality, community involvement, and even temperament. The inflated edit count is not a disqualification, but means there is less substantive evidence to judge these things. Please come back later. --He has done some great work. I will support him after two months. --I think plenty of checks exist for sysop vigilantism without needing to grant sysophood to people who have actively supported some of the worst Wikipedia users I can think of."Having a high I.Q." and wanting to "fix links" aren't exactly convincing reasons for adminship, at least for me. Also, he doesn't seem to be good at communicating with others, judging from the animosity that he's generated and from his lack of contributions to pages outside the Main namespace. Maybe someday, but not now. --I'm having trouble assuming good faith with this user because I find it hard to believe that someone could really fail to understand the numerous (numerous!) attempts by a diverse range of users to communicate with him. [[User:Lowellian|<nowiki></nowiki>]]&mdash;Oppose. Sam has failed to respect others and has not sought compromise.I've only ever seen good edits by him, and he sounds cool-headed.No.  Too early.  However, user seems to be a good contributor.  Will probably support after user has been around a bit longer.Support- highly dedicated to fighting trolls and vandals such as that one below calling him a "lap-dog". -Recent actions by Snowspinner and certain other users has caused me to overcome my "too soon" objection. --No, <s>[[User:Snowspinner|Snowspinner]], [[User:172|Abe]] and [[User:GrazingshipIV|GrazingshipIV]] work way too close I worry about these users getting together as Sysops, makes me wonder who is cabal that they often cite.</s> Ok, ok snow, i'll admit he is not in the "cabal" but he's still too new for me.I am unsure whether squash would make a good admin. I'm concerned that he seems to be fixated upon gaining adminship, which I think is a bit of a negative thing. I've seen mostly good behavior from him, though, so I can't really decide. --User has more edits than I had when when I was made admin.Too new, IMO; especially so for a self-nomination. Come back in a couple of months :)'''896''' is too few edits.  <s>(And claiming "about" 1,000 edits is misleading and detrimental to your request.)</s>  Should return after getting a better feel for the comminity and the job. - [[User:Texture|<font color=red>T&#949;x</font>]][[User Talk:Texture|<font color=blue>&#964;</font>]]Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't this user join within the last two weeks or so?I think there will very likely come a time when Mike H is a worthy candidate, but it is far too soon.  I have had good conversations with Mike here, but I am also a little nervous because I worry that his style of dispute resolution is confrontational and leads to hostility.  I will need much more time to observe Mike's approach to disagreements and conflict before I am comfortable casting a vote to Support.Support. About 1000 edits going back to February.  Re: edit wars, "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone"Support: Seen him copyediting and updating materials around, and he seems to be the "light housekeeper" type. --support.
